# Betinardi Antidote SB-1 Putter Guide

**Your Putter:** Betinardi Antidote SB-1  
**Specs:** 35" length, 69° lie angle, 2.5° loft  
**Finish:** Diamond Blast + Sapphire Blue  
**Category:** Premium zero-torque blade putter

---

## WHAT YOU GOT (THE BREAKDOWN)

### **Zero Torque Technology**
- **What it means:** The shaft runs directly through the center of gravity (CG)
- **Why it matters:** Reduces twisting/mis-rotation on off-center hits
- **Benefit:** More consistent roll and distance control, even on mishits
- **Best for:** Golfers with inconsistent stroke mechanics (like most of us)

### **Center-Shafted Design**
- **Profile:** The shaft connects at the center of the head (not traditional heel connection)
- **Feel:** Takes some adjustment, but most golfers adapt in 2-3 rounds
- **Advantage:** Maximum stability, minimal torque
- **Visual:** Modern look; Bettinardi nailed the aesthetics with the Sapphire Blue

### **Simply Balanced Technology**
- **Engineering:** Optimized weight distribution throughout the head
- **Result:** Smooth pendulum motion, easy alignment
- **Feel:** Like the putter wants to swing on-plane for you

### **F.I.T. Face (Feel Impact Technology)**
- **How it works:** Deep groove pattern removes 55% of face material
- **Result:** Less of the ball contacts the face at impact
- **Benefit:** Dramatically softer feel + consistent distance control
- **Sound:** Muted, premium click (not a sharp clang)

### **Diamond Blast Finish**
- **Function:** Reduces glare at address (tour player feature)
- **Aesthetics:** Matte, refined look (no shine to distract you)
- **Durability:** Tour-level finish, handles weather well

### **T-Alignment Guide**
- **Design:** Sapphire blue "T" marking at the back
- **Purpose:** Quick target line visualization
- **Reality:** Small but highly effective; reviewers noted easy alignment

## YOUR PUTTER SPECS EXPLAINED

| Spec | Your Setting | What It Does |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Length: 35"** | Standard | Balanced for most posture types; fits your custom fit |
| **Lie: 69°** | Slightly upright | Matches your posture (custom fit); promotes square toe at impact |
| **Loft: 2.5°** | Modern (low) | Reduces launch angle; promotes topspin (better for consistent roll) |
| **Center-shaft** | Zero torque | Minimizes miss-hits, maximum stability |
| **Milled Face** | F.I.T. | Soft feel + distance consistency |

## HOW TO USE THIS PUTTER WELL

### **Setup**
- Address the ball slightly forward of center (putter naturally has minimal loft)
- Use the T-alignment guide — trust it, it works
- The center-shaft may feel offset at first — play 3-4 rounds to adjust

### **Stroke**
- Let the putter swing like a pendulum (zero torque design encourages this)
- The head wants to stay square — don't fight it
- F.I.T. face gives you feedback; trust the distance feel

### **Distance Control**
- This putter excels at distance consistency
- 10-footer feels the same as a 6-footer mechanically — same smooth stroke
- The milled face gives you confidence on longer putts

---

## PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS

✅ **Strengths:**
- Consistent distance control (soft feel = reliable feedback)
- Stable on off-center hits (zero torque = forgiveness)
- Excellent alignment (T-guide + center-shaft make it hard to miss aim)
- Premium feel (top-tier milling + finish)
- Ideal for someone with a solid stroke (like you, post-fitting)

❌ **Learning Curve:**
- Center-shaft takes 3-5 rounds to adjust visually
- Different toe-hang than traditional putters (this is good, just different)
- May feel "lighter" than older mallet putters initially

---

## MONEY SPENT WELL

**Price point:** ~$450-500 retail  
**Betinardi reputation:** Tour putter (used by tour pros)  
**Value:** Top-tier putting tool

**Reality check:** This putter won't make you hole more putts by itself, but it will:
- Eliminate mis-hits
- Improve distance control
- Boost confidence (premium feel matters)
- Reward good stroke mechanics (you have them, post-fitting)

---

## MAINTENANCE

- **Cleaning:** Soft cloth, no harsh chemicals (preserve the diamond blast)
- **Loft/Lie:** Club Champion has your specs — don't adjust
- **Face:** Never clean the grooved face aggressively (firecrawl the milling)
- **Storage:** Headcover on between rounds (magnetic — easy to use)

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Play 3-4 rounds** to adjust to center-shaft feel
2. **Track your putting stats** in your golf dashboard (strokes gained from 10 feet, 3-putts, etc.)
3. **Trust the T-alignment** — it's tour-proven
4. **Compare distance control** before/after irons (new equipment baseline)

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

You bought a **tour-level putter that's designed for someone with your swing profile**: someone who's getting professionally fit and cares about precision. 

The Antidote SB-1 **rewards good mechanics**. Since you're getting custom-fit irons + this putter, you're building a kit that will **punish poor technique and reward solid swings**.

**Translation:** Invest in lessons or practice mechanics. This putter is good enough to be the last putter you buy for years.
