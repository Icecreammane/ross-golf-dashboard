## 🎯 Why This Exists

**Problem:**
- Multi-agent systems are expensive and complex
- Agents don't share context
- Coordination is hard

**Solution:**
- ONE agent (Jarvis) with FIVE modes
- Shared context across all modes
- Instant switching
- Lower cost, higher effectiveness

**Result:**
- Systematic customer acquisition (SALES MODE)
- Zero support delays (SUPPORT MODE)
- Competitive advantage (RESEARCH MODE)
- Stable product (DEV MODE)
- Consistent execution (ACCOUNTABILITY MODE)

## ⏰ Daily Schedule

```
7:30am  - Morning brief + commitment
8:00am  - SALES MODE (find leads)
10:00am - Support check
