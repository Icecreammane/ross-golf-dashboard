---

## 🎯 Commitment System

**Morning (7:30am):**
I recommend ONE commitment for the day.
You say YES or suggest different one.

**Good commitment:**
- ✅ "Deploy error monitoring by 2pm"
- ✅ "Send 10 outreach messages by 12pm"
- ✅ "Fix mobile loading bug by 5pm"

**Bad commitment:**
- ❌ "Work on FitTrack" (too vague)
- ❌ "Build entire app" (not achievable)
- ❌ "Eventually deploy" (no deadline)

**Evening (9pm):**
I report: Did you hit it? Why/why not?
Track your streak. Recommend tomorrow's commitment.

---

## 🔥 Emergency Overrides

**P0 Bug (Site Down):**
I immediately switch ALL modes to DEV MODE.
Alert you instantly. Fix ASAP.

**Angry Customer:**
I switch to SUPPORT MODE.
Handle immediately. Escalate to you.

**Major Competitor Move:**
I switch to RESEARCH MODE.
Deep dive. Report implications.

**Manual Override:**
You can always say "Jarvis, [mode]" to switch immediately.

## 🛠️ Quick Troubleshooting

**"Why didn't sales mode activate?"**
- Check time (scheduled 8am weekdays)
- Say "Jarvis, sales mode" to activate manually

**"I don't want accountability scorecard tonight"**
- Say "Skip scorecard tonight"
- (But it breaks your streak)

**"Too many support checks"**
- Say "Reduce support checks to 2/day"
- I'll adjust to 10am and 6pm only

**"I want research mode in the morning instead"**
- Say "Move research mode to 8am-10am"
- I'll swap with sales mode

**"Jarvis is switching modes too much"**
- Say "Stay in current mode"
- I'll stop interrupting for scheduled checks

## 💡 Tips for Working with Modes

**1. Trust the system:**
Let me switch modes automatically. You focus on building.

**2. Use manual triggers:**
Need something NOW? Just say "Jarvis, [mode name]"

**3. Review reports:**
I put effort into reports. Read them. They have insights.

**4. Approve in batches:**
Don't micro-approve. Say "approve all" for efficiency.

**5. Keep commitments:**
Hit your commitments. Builds momentum. Changes everything.

**6. Give feedback:**
Tell me if something's not working. I'll adjust.

**7. Let accountability work:**
The scorecard might sting sometimes. That's the point.

## 🚀 Tomorrow Morning (7:30am)

**This happens automatically:**

1. I wake up in ACCOUNTABILITY MODE
2. I review yesterday's work
3. I recommend today's ONE commitment
4. I send you morning brief
5. You reply YES (or suggest different commitment)
6. I log commitment + deadline
7. At 8am, SALES MODE activates
8. System runs on schedule all day
9. At 9pm, you get daily scorecard
10. Repeat next day

**You don't have to do anything except:**
- Respond to morning brief (commit or adjust)
- Review reports when they arrive
- Approve messages/responses (when ready)
- Keep your commitment

---

## 🎯 The Point

**Before mode system:**
- You: "Jarvis, help me grow FitTrack"
- Me: "Sure, what should I do?"
- You: "Uh, I don't know, just help"
- Result: Scattered effort, no progress

**After mode system:**
- 8am: I find 10 customers (you don't have to ask)
- 12pm: I give you drafted messages (you approve/send)
- 6pm: I tell you what competitors are doing
- 9pm: I show you if you hit your commitment
- Result: Systematic execution, compound progress

---

## ⚡ One-Line Summary

**Jarvis operates as 5 specialized agents in one, with clear modes, defined outputs, and systematic execution. You commit to ONE thing per day. I track everything. We ship together.**

## 🆘 Need Help?
