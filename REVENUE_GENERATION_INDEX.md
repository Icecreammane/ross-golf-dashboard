This is your wedge. This is how you win.

## 📝 QUICK REFERENCE

### Pricing
- **Trial:** 7 days free
- **Paid:** $10/month
- **No tiers, no upsells**

### Target Customer

- Know their macros
- Hate complicated apps
- Value speed > features

### Competitive Advantages
1. Speed (30 sec vs 2+ min MFP)
2. Simplicity (3 features vs 47)
3. Pricing honesty ($10/mo vs $80/yr + paywalls)
4. Built by a real lifter (not PE firm)

### Ross's Moat
- Real person (not corporation)

## 🚨 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

**If Something Breaks:**
1. Open [`launch-automation/emergency-checklist.md`](launch-automation/emergency-checklist.md)

## 💡 DECISION FRAMEWORK

**When deciding what to work on, ask:**

1. Will this increase revenue? (Yes = do it)
2. Did users explicitly request this? (Multiple users = build)
3. Can I build this in <4 hours? (Yes = quick win)
4. Will this reduce churn? (Yes = critical)
5. Is this essential for launch? (Yes = do now)

**If answers are mostly "no" → Don't do it (yet)**
