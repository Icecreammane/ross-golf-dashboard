## Post Body:

Hey r/golf!

I'm launching something I wish existed when I was trying to break 90: **affordable, personalized video swing analysis with custom drills.**

**Here's what I'm offering:**
- 📹 Video analysis of your swing (any angle)
- 🎯 Custom drill recommendations 
- 📊 Weekly check-ins and progress tracking
- 💬 Unlimited questions via text
- 💰 $29/month (cancel anytime)

**The catch:** I'm limiting this to **10 members** to start, so I can give everyone proper attention. First 10 get **lifetime 50% off** ($14.50/month).

**How it works:**
1. Record your swing on your phone
2. Text or email it to me
3. Get detailed analysis + drill plan within 24 hours
4. Practice, improve, repeat

**Who am I?** Just a golfer obsessed with improvement who wants to help others get better. No fancy credentials, just real experience grinding to improve my own game.

**Landing page:** [YOUR_URL_HERE]

I'd genuinely love feedback from this community - what would make you trust a service like this? What am I missing? What sounds off?

Thanks for reading! 🏌️

## Alternative Post (More Casual):

Hey r/golf!

Quick question: Would you pay $29/month for personalized video swing analysis + custom drills?

I'm thinking about launching this. The idea:
- You send me your swing video (any angle, any device)
- I analyze it and send back a detailed breakdown + custom drills
- We do weekly check-ins, unlimited texting for questions
- Cancel anytime

First 10 people get lifetime 50% off ($14.50/month) because I want to prove this works before scaling up.

I'm not a PGA pro - just a golfer who's obsessed with improvement and has helped a few buddies break through plateaus.

Honest feedback welcome - is this something you'd try?

## Tips for Posting:

1. **Best time:** Evening (6-9pm) when r/golf is most active
2. **Flair:** Use "Discussion" or "Question" flair (not "Promotion")
3. **Engage:** Respond to every comment in first hour
4. **Be humble:** Ask for feedback, don't hard sell
5. **Offer value:** Consider offering 1-2 free analyses to prove value
6. **Follow rules:** Check r/golf rules - some subs require mod approval for services

## Response Templates:

**If someone asks about credentials:**
"Great question - I'm not a PGA pro. I'm just a golfer who's obsessed with improvement and has spent way too much time analyzing swings (mine and others). Think of this as a knowledgeable friend helping you out, not a formal coaching credential. That's why I'm keeping it affordable and cancel-anytime."

**If someone asks why they should trust you:**
"Totally fair! That's exactly why I'm doing lifetime 50% off for the first 10 - I want to prove this works before asking anyone to pay full price. And it's cancel anytime, so if it's not helping after the first month, no hard feelings."

**If someone offers constructive criticism:**
"This is exactly the feedback I needed - thank you! [Address their point specifically]"

**If someone is interested:**
"Awesome! Head to [URL] and reserve your spot. You'll be in the first batch, so you'll get extra attention as I dial this in."
