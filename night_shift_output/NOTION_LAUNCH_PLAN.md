## Revenue Projection

**Conservative (Week 1):**
- 10-15 sales = $240-360

**Realistic (First month):**
- 20-30 sales = $480-720

**Aggressive (First month):**

**This counts toward $500 MRR goal.** ✓

## What This Unlocks

✅ You've shipped a product  
✅ You've made money directly from something you built  
✅ You have proof of concept for "build → sell"  
✅ You can do this with form checks, meal plans, DFS intel  
✅ Momentum for week 2 and beyond

## Key Mindset

This is NOT perfect. It doesn't need to be.
- It works? Ship it.
- People want it? Iterate.
- You learn from real users? Scale it.

Perfect template in 2 weeks = zero revenue
Good template in 2 days = momentum

**Choose momentum.**

## Files You'll Need
