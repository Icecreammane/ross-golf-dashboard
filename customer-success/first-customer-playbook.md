# First Customer Playbook: From Trial to Advocate
**Goal:** Convert trial users into paying customers, then advocates  
**Created:** 2026-02-07 03:20 CST

## PLAYBOOK PHILOSOPHY

**Reality Check:**
- First 10 customers = most important 10 customers
- They'll shape the product with feedback
- They'll be your first testimonials
- They'll tell friends (or won't, if you mess up)

**Success = Not just getting paid, but creating advocates**

## ONBOARDING EMAIL SEQUENCE

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediately After Signup)

**Subject:** Welcome to FitTrack! Here's how to get started

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Welcome to FitTrack! 🎉

You've got 7 days to try it out - no credit card required.

Here's how to get the most out of your trial:

**Day 1 (Today):** Log your meals for the day
- Click "+ Add Food" and search for what you ate
- Set your macro targets in Settings (or I can help you calculate them)
- See how close you are to hitting your goals

**Day 2-3:** Get in the rhythm
- Log breakfast, lunch, dinner
- Use "Recent Foods" for speed (most people eat the same meals)
- Save favorite meals as templates

**Day 4-7:** See the difference
- Check your progress over the week
- Notice how much faster FitTrack is vs your old tracker
- Decide if it's worth $10/month for you

**Need help?** Reply to this email - I'm Ross, I built FitTrack, and I actually read these.

**Quick tip:** Most lifters see the biggest benefit in speed. If you meal prep, log all your meals for the week on Sunday. Takes 5 minutes, done for the week.

Let me know how it goes!

Ross
Founder, FitTrack

P.S. - If you hate something about FitTrack, tell me. I'm building this based on what users actually want.
```

**Why this works:**
- Personal tone (not corporate)
- Clear onboarding steps (remove friction)
- Sets expectations (7 days, then decide)
- Offers help (two-way conversation)
- Quick tip (demonstrates value immediately)

---

### Email 2: Day 3 Check-In (72 Hours After Signup)

**Subject:** How's FitTrack working for you?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Just checking in - you've been using FitTrack for 3 days now.

Quick question: **What's one thing you wish FitTrack did differently?**

(Seriously, I want to know. Even if it's "nothing, it's perfect" - that's helpful feedback too.)

Here's what most people love by day 3:
- ✅ Speed (30 seconds to log vs 2+ minutes on MFP)
- ✅ No ads (actually see your macros without distractions)
- ✅ Clean dashboard (macros front and center, not buried)

And what they ask for:
- "Can I bulk-log meals for the week?" (Yes - coming soon!)
- "Can I track body measurements?" (On the roadmap)
- "Can I export my data?" (Already built - Settings → Export)

**You've got 4 days left in your trial.** If FitTrack is working for you, I'd love to keep you as a customer. If not, no hard feelings - but I'd still love to hear what didn't work.

Either way, thanks for trying it out.

Ross

P.S. - If you're meal prepping, here's a pro tip: Log your "meal prep chicken" as a custom food with the exact macros. Then just track servings. Saves time.
```

**Why this works:**
- Asks for feedback (makes user feel heard)
- Reminds them of benefits (reinforces value)
- Soft CTA (no pressure, but plants seed)
- Pro tip (adds value even if they churn)

---

### Email 3: Day 6 - Trial Ending Soon (24 Hours Before Trial Ends)

**Subject:** Your FitTrack trial ends tomorrow - worth keeping?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Your 7-day trial ends tomorrow. Time to decide: is FitTrack worth $10/month for you?

Here's how to think about it:

**If you said YES to these, keep FitTrack:**
- ✅ I track macros regularly (not just occasionally)
- ✅ Speed matters (I hate waiting for apps to load)
- ✅ I value my data privacy (no ads, no data selling)
- ✅ I want simple tools, not feature bloat

**If you said NO to these, cancel (no hard feelings):**
- ❌ I only track once in a while
- ❌ I need a free option (budget is tight)
- ❌ I need features FitTrack doesn't have yet
- ❌ MFP/Cronometer works fine for me

**To keep your account:** Just add a credit card in Settings → Billing. You'll be charged $10/month starting tomorrow.

**To cancel:** Do nothing - your account goes read-only tomorrow, no charge.

Either way, thanks for giving FitTrack a shot. I built this for lifters like you, and your feedback has been valuable.

Ross

P.S. - If price is the only issue (you like FitTrack but $10/month is tight), reply to this email. I'll work something out.
```

**Why this works:**
- Honest framing (helps user self-select)
- Clear CTAs (keep or cancel, both easy)
- No manipulation (respects user's decision)
- Escape hatch (price objection handled)
- Gratitude (builds goodwill even if they churn)

## TRIAL-TO-PAID CONVERSION TACTICS

### Tactic 1: First Success Moment (Trigger-Based Email)
**Trigger:** User logs 7 days in a row  
**Subject:** Nice! You've logged 7 days straight

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Just noticed you've logged 7 days in a row. That's awesome - consistency is where results come from.

Quick question: What made you stick with it? (Genuinely curious - helps me understand what's working.)

If FitTrack is helping you stay consistent, consider keeping it after your trial. $10/month is less than 2 protein bars. 💪

Ross
```

**Why this works:** Celebrates user success, creates positive association with product

---

### Tactic 2: Compare to Old Tracker
**Trigger:** User mentions MFP/Cronometer in feedback  
**Subject:** How does FitTrack compare to [MFP/Cronometer]?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw you mentioned using [MyFitnessPal] before. 

Quick question: What's better in FitTrack? And what's worse?

(I'm not fishing for compliments - genuinely want to know where FitTrack wins and where it falls short.)

Ross
```

**Why this works:** Gets specific feedback, identifies what's working, surfaces objections

---

### Tactic 3: Friend Discount (Social Proof)
**Trigger:** User converts to paid  
**Subject:** Thanks for subscribing! Here's a gift for your gym friends

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

You're officially a FitTrack customer. Hell yeah. 🎉

As a thank you, here's a referral link for your gym friends:
[unique referral link]

They get 20% off their first month. You get $5 credit for each friend who subscribes.

If you know anyone frustrated with MFP or Cronometer, send them this. Help a friend, support FitTrack. Win-win.

Thanks for believing in what I'm building.

Ross

P.S. - Your feedback matters 10x more now that you're a paying customer. If you want a feature, tell me - I prioritize based on what paying users actually need.
```

**Why this works:** Rewards conversion, encourages referrals, signals prioritization

---

## TESTIMONIAL EXTRACTION PROCESS

### When to Ask: After 14 Days of Paid Subscription
**Why:** User has used it enough to have real opinion, still in honeymoon phase

**Subject:** Quick favor? (30 seconds)

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

You've been using FitTrack for 2 weeks now. Quick favor?

**Could you answer one question for me?**

"What's the #1 reason you're using FitTrack instead of MyFitnessPal/Cronometer/[other tracker]?"

(I want to use real user quotes on the website - helps other lifters understand why FitTrack might work for them.)

Just hit reply with a sentence or two. I'll send you a $10 credit as a thank you.

Ross
```

**Why this works:**
- Easy ask (one question, not 10)
- Clear purpose (transparency builds trust)
- Incentive ($10 credit = one month free)
- Low friction (just hit reply)

---

### Follow-Up: Turn Quote into Testimonial

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Perfect! This is gold: "[their quote]"

Can I use this on the FitTrack homepage? Format:

"[their quote]"
— [First Name], [Bodybuilder/Powerlifter/CrossFitter]

Cool with you? If you want to tweak the wording, let me know.

Your $10 credit is applied - you won't be charged next month.

Thanks for helping other lifters find FitTrack.

Ross
```

**Why this works:** Confirms permission, shows exactly how it'll appear, delivers value immediately

---

## CASE STUDY INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

### Use for: Power users (30+ days, logged consistently)

**Reach out:**
```
Hey [Name],

You've been crushing it with FitTrack - [specific observation: logged 30 days straight, tracked through a bulk, etc.].

Would you be down for a 15-minute call? I want to do a case study:
- How you use FitTrack
- What results you're seeing
- What you'd tell other lifters

I'll feature you on the blog (if you want), and give you 3 months free.

Interest? We can do Zoom, phone, or just written Q&A if you prefer.

Ross
```

**Interview Questions:**
1. What were you using before FitTrack? What sucked about it?
2. Why did you try FitTrack?
3. What's the #1 thing FitTrack does better?
4. How has FitTrack helped your training/physique?
5. Who should use FitTrack? Who shouldn't?
6. If you could add one feature, what would it be?

**Deliverable:** Blog post: "How [Name] Uses FitTrack to [specific result]"

---

## REFERRAL PROGRAM STRUCTURE

### Basic Mechanics
- **Referrer gets:** $5 credit per successful referral
- **Referee gets:** 20% off first month ($8 instead of $10)
- **Tracked via:** Unique referral links (ross-abc123.fittrack.app)

### Implementation
```python
# Simple referral tracking (backend)
# User gets unique code: user.id → base64 → short code
# Landing page: fittrack.app?ref=ABC123
# On signup, track referrer_id
# On first payment, credit referrer $5
```

### Referral Leaderboard (Optional - Gamify Later)
Top 3 referrers each month get:
- #1: Free year of FitTrack
- #2: 6 months free
- #3: 3 months free

**Only implement if:** 50+ paying customers (not worth complexity before then)

---

## CHURN PREVENTION

### Early Warning Signs (Monitor These)
1. **Hasn't logged in 3 days** (was logging daily)
2. **Hasn't logged food in 5 days** (was logging regularly)
3. **Only using free trial, 1 day left, no payment method added**

### Intervention Emails

**Email: Re-engagement (Trigger: 3 days no login)**
**Subject:** Miss you! Everything okay?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Noticed you haven't logged in for a few days. Everything okay?

Sometimes life gets busy - totally get it. But if there's something not working in FitTrack, I want to fix it.

Quick question: What would make FitTrack worth coming back to?

Ross
```

---

**Email: Cancellation Feedback (Trigger: User cancels)**
**Subject:** Sorry to see you go. One question?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw you canceled. No hard feelings - FitTrack isn't for everyone.

One quick question (helps me improve):

**What made you decide to cancel?**
- [ ] Too expensive
- [ ] Missing features (what features?)
- [ ] Not using it enough
- [ ] Found something better (what?)
- [ ] Other (tell me)

Just reply with what fits. Your feedback helps me build a better product.

Thanks for trying FitTrack, and good luck with your training.

Ross

P.S. - If you change your mind in the next 30 days, reply and I'll reactivate your account with all your data intact.
```

**Why this works:** Exit interview, keeps door open, shows you care about improvement

## SUCCESS METRICS (Track These)

### Conversion Metrics
- **Trial → Paid:** Target 30% (industry average: 15-25%)
- **Month 1 retention:** Target 80%
- **Month 3 retention:** Target 60%
- **Churn rate:** Target <10% monthly

### Engagement Metrics
- **Daily active users:** Target 60% of paid users log daily

- **NPS (Net Promoter Score):** Target 50+ (9-10 rating)

---

## DASHBOARD TO BUILD (Week 2)

**Key Metrics to Track:**
1. Trial signups today / this week / all time
2. Trial → Paid conversion rate
3. Active trials (how many days left)
4. Churn rate (monthly)
5. MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
6. Engagement: % users who logged today/this week

**Tools:**
- Build custom dashboard (Python/Flask + Chart.js)
- Or use Stripe + Google Sheets (simpler MVP)

---

## CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

### Primary: Email
- All automated emails (onboarding, trial reminders)
- Personal follow-ups from Ross

### Secondary: In-App Messages (If Time Allows)
- "Tip of the day" style nudges
- Feature announcements
- Success celebrations ("You've logged 30 days!")

### Tertiary: Discord/Slack Community (Phase 2)
- Only if 100+ paying customers
- Creates community, reduces churn
- **Don't do too early** (empty community = bad look)

---

## EXAMPLE TESTIMONIAL TARGETS

**Good Testimonial:**
> "MyFitnessPal was taking 5 minutes to log breakfast. FitTrack takes 30 seconds. That alone is worth $10/month."  
> — Jake, Powerlifter

**Great Testimonial:**
> "I've tried every macro tracker. They all try to do everything. FitTrack just tracks macros. Finally, an app that gets out of my way."  
> — Sarah, Bodybuilder

**Perfect Testimonial:**
> "MFP removed the barcode scanner and wanted $80/year. FitTrack is $10/month, no BS, no bait-and-switch. Switched and never looked back."  
> — Mike, CrossFit Athlete

**Why these work:** Specific, relatable, addresses pain point, mentions competitors

---

**Bottom Line:** First customers aren't just revenue - they're your marketing team. Treat them like gold. Ask for feedback, implement it, thank them publicly, give them credit. They'll tell their friends, write testimonials, and shape FitTrack into something great.

Make 10 customers love you before you try to get 100. 💪
