**Prepared for:** Ross  
**Context:** Comparing to your Titleist T150 specs  
**Bottom Line:** Similar performance category, excellent forgiveness, 3x cheaper

## THE QUICK ANSWER

The **Callaway Paradym** is in the same "players' distance" category as your T150. Both are designed for:
- ✅ Low-to-mid handicappers (4-12 range)

- ✅ Compact profiles that look & feel premium
- ✅ Good distance without being "game improvement" level

**The main difference:** Callaway is more forgiving (better for mishits), Titleist is more tour-oriented. For you, that's actually better value.

## WHY CALLAWAY PARADYM SPECIFICALLY WORKS FOR YOU

### 1️⃣ **Same Handicap Target (4-12)**
You're getting fit clubs from a pro, which means you likely swing around 85-95 mph. Both the T150 and Paradym are built for players in your swing speed range.

**Callaway wins:** Slightly more forgiving if you have occasional off-center hits.

### 2️⃣ **Compact Profile (Tour Looks)**
Both irons look professional and compact at address. You won't feel like you're hitting a game-improvement club.

**Tie:** Both equally tour-oriented in appearance.

### 3️⃣ **Premium Forgiveness Without Sacrifice**
- T150 = Tour feel + modest forgiveness
- Paradym = Tour feel + **excellent** forgiveness

You get the best of both worlds with Callaway. Better insurance for slightly off-center hits.

**Callaway wins:** Up to 67g of tungsten weighting (more than T150) = better stability.

### 4️⃣ **Shot Shape Control**
Both irons let you work the ball (draw/fade). You won't be locked into one shot shape.

**Tie:** Both allow shot shaping; Paradym slightly easier to control distance.

### 5️⃣ **Distance Consistency**
- T150 = Strong lofts, consistent distance
- Paradym = AI-optimized per club + Speed Frame = **more consistent across the face**

Paradym's AI design means each iron is individually optimized for ball speed. T150 is excellent but more traditional.

**Callaway wins:** More consistent distance on off-center hits.

### 6️⃣ **Premium Feel**
- T150 = Forged steel, firm feedback (tour feedback)
- Paradym = Forged 455 + Urethane Microspheres (premium soft feel)

Both feel premium. Paradym actually feels slightly softer/more premium.

**Callaway wins:** Better sound and feel, arguably more premium.

## SHAFT CUSTOMIZATION

### **Your Current Setup**
- Shaft: Oban CT-115 Steel X
- Why: Mid-range steel, responsive, X-flex for your swing

### **Callaway Paradym Stock Options**
- True Temper Elevate MPH 95 (stock)
- Project X HZRDUS Silver (stock)
- KBS Tour C-Taper (available custom)
- **Can get Oban CT-115?** Yes — custom shaft options available through Fairway Jockey or boutique fitters

**The reality:** You can absolutely build Paradyms with Oban CT-115 Steel X (same shaft as your T150). Cost might be $50-100 more, but still way cheaper than T150.

## REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE

### **Tested by Reviewers** (8-handicap golfer)
*GolferGeeks Review:*
> "Excellent playability with a splash of game improvement features in an attractive compact clubhead. They launch easily, are plenty long, and cover up for minor mishits. You get a lot of the characteristics you look for in a 'player iron' (compact head, less offset, premium sound, soft feel) and some of the characteristics of a game improvement iron."

*Today's Golfer Review:*
> "The Paradym uses the same 455 stainless steel normally found in metalwoods. Thanks to A.I. tech, Callaway managed to create the brand's most powerful forged iron face ever. Each body has three differing-sized 'frames', and each iron loft has had its own frame formation created to ensure the best possible performance from each club."

**Translation:** You get tour-level feel + game-improvement forgiveness. That's a win.

## WHEN PARADYM IS BETTER THAN T150

✅ **You want more forgiveness** — Dual tungsten weighting is generous  
✅ **You value feel/sound** — Urethane Microspheres = softer, better sound  
✅ **You have a mid-handicap swing** (5-12) — Paradym is optimized for this range  
✅ **You want consistency** — AI-optimized face per club = more stable miss-hits  
✅ **You want distance** — Jacked lofts + AI design = longer than T150  
✅ **You value your wallet** — $800 vs $4,700 is a no-brainer if performance is similar

---

## WHEN T150 IS BETTER THAN PARADYM

❌ You're a low single-digit (under 4) — T150 is more tour-oriented  
❌ You want maximum tour feedback — T150 is firmer  
❌ You want a compact head — Both are compact, but T150 slightly smaller  
❌ You specifically want Titleist branding — Some golfers prefer the T-series reputation  
❌ You want absolute max distance — Both are long, but this is marginal
