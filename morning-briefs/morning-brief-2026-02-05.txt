Good morning, Ross. Here's your morning brief for Thursday, February 05.

Your calendar is clear today—no scheduled events.

You're all caught up on tasks. Nothing urgent on the queue.

No overnight builds completed. Everything's quiet on the engineering front.

Open loops. 3 proposals awaiting approval

One more thing: Your golf club decision is still pending - want me to schedule a fitting at True Spec?

That's your brief for today. Have a great day!
