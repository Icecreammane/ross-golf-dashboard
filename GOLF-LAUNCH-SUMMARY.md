## 🎯 Pricing Strategy

**Current setup:**
- Regular: $29/month
- Early bird: $14.50/month (50% off for life)
- Limited to first 10 members

**Why this works:**
- $14.50 is impulse-buy territory
- "Lifetime" discount makes it feel special
- Scarcity (10 spots) creates urgency
- $29 regular price is still affordable vs. traditional coaching ($100+/lesson)

---

## 💬 Reddit Post Strategy

**Recommended approach:**
- Title: "I'm Launching a $29/month Video Swing Analysis Service - Would Love Your Feedback (First 10 Get 50% Off)"
- Flair: "Discussion" (not "Promotion")
- Timing: 6-9pm ET when r/golf is active
- Tone: Humble, asking for feedback, not hard selling

**Key points to emphasize in comments:**
- You're not a PGA pro, just an obsessed golfer
- Cancel anytime (removes risk)
- You're limiting to 10 to give proper attention
- Open to feedback and iteration
