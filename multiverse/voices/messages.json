First off, bro, your freelancing and business are really starting to pick up. Youre making $2800 a month now, which is solid, but it came with its fair share of hustle. You started working on API integrations for fitness apps and ended up bagging some pretty major clients that were a bit of a challenge at first.\n\nOne thing I gotta tell you is to keep pushing yourself out there. Dont be afraid to reach out to people even if youre not sure how its gonna go. It worked big time last year when you connected with those industry pros, and it really helped your work flow better.\n\nAlso, bro, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff too much. You\u2019re doing great and I see some major growth coming up. Just keep grinding, stay patient, and believe in yourself.\n\nSo yeah, overall, things are looking good but theres still room to improve. Keep hustling, Ross, because youre killing it!\n\nPeace out!",

      "text": "Yo, current Ross here. Listen up, bro. So right now in February 2031, Im making about $4300 a month from my freelancing and business stuff. Yeah, its not bad at all. Realized early on that remote work and projects are the way to go for me.\n\nSo I moved to Florida with my wife and kid last year, which was a game changer. You gotta do what makes you happy, man. The sun, the beaches, living in a house we bought together \u2013 it\u2019s lit. And starting my own little business has been wild. Its not always sunshine and rainbows though, bro.\n\nThere are days when I look back at all the work hours, the sleepless nights, and it feels like too much sometimes. But you know what? Looking at where I am now compared to a few years ago, it was worth every single sacrifice.\n\nSo my advice is keep pushing for your goals but dont forget to chill out once in a while. Take that vacation when you can afford it. Youre working hard and building something solid here, man. Just remember to stay focused and don\u2019t let the day-to-day stuff get you down.\n\nIn five years? Im happier than I thought possible but theres still plenty of regrets, bro. Missing out on spending time with family, not traveling enough \u2013 those are big ones for me. So enjoy your twenties while they last but keep an eye on the bigger picture too.\n\nKeep grinding and staying true to yourself, Ross. You got this. Go get em, tiger!",

It\u2019s solid bro, but remember those early days when it was just you and your laptop in the coffee shop?\n\nI\u2019m doing pretty well now, full-time freelance and my biz is kicking ass down here in Florida. I got clients who stick around longer than you think they would, and thats what makes the difference. But let me tell ya bro, there were times when it felt like a roller coaster ride.\n\nYou gotta be persistent and make sure to always keep learning. Dont be afraid to pivot if something isn\u2019t working. And hey, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff too much because trust me, some days youre gonna feel like giving up. But stick with it, the rewards are worth it.\n\nJust remember, this aint a sprint, its a marathon bro. So enjoy the journey and stay hungry for growth. You got this!",

But trust me, dont freak out. Stick with it and keep pushing. Remember, you got talent and skills that people want. Just stay focused on building that business.\n\nSo yeah, Im doing great now but let\u2019s be real: there were times I felt like giving up too.

So right now in 2026, things are looking pretty solid but trust me when I say there\u2019s so much more on the horizon if you stick with it. You know how you\u2019ve been grinding away at those freelancing gigs and building that business? Well, let me tell you, by the time we hit February 2036, you\u2019ll be making a cool $25K a month from your freelancing and consulting work in AI integration. It\u2019s nuts, but its real.\n\nAnd guess what, bro? You\u2019re gonna develop your own fitness app which is going to blow up pretty big-time. And the rental properties you started buying last year in Florida? Those are already paying off big dividends. I mean, who knew a beach house and some small rentals would be such a smart move?\n\nBut here\u2019s the deal, man: there will still be challenges along the way. There\u2019s gonna be times when it feels like every step forward is two steps back. But trust me, the struggles are just part of the journey to get where you\u2019re meant to be. So keep pushing and don\u2019t let any setbacks hold you back.\n\nAnd remember that happiness score I mentioned? It\u2019s sitting at 97 outta 100. Yeah, it\u2019s a pretty damn high number. And I can tell you with absolute certainty there\u2019s no regret in this future version of yourself. No regrets at all.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I want you to do: focus on building your skills, expanding your network, and just keep moving forward every single day. It might feel slow now, but looking back from where we are in 2036, it\u2019ll all make sense and seem totally worth it.\n\nKeep grinding, bro. You got this. Go crush it.",

Now I\u2019m doing steady work as a freelance consultant in Florida, with consistent monthly recurring revenue of $1000 MRR. And the best part? Ive expanded into content creation and coaching on the side.\n\nI know you\u2019re probably thinking this is all too good to be true right now, but it\u2019s real, bro. Keep pushing through those hard times because they will pay off big time later. Just stay focused, take care of yourself, and don\u2019t give up when things get tough. I\u2019ve got regrets, sure, but nothing major - just a few little things here and there that I wish Id done differently early on.\n\nSo keep going, bro. The future is bright if you work for it.
