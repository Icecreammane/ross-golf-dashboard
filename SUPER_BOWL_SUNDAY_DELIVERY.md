## 💡 HONEST TAKE

**Ross, here's the truth:**

Getting from $0 → $500 MRR will take **6-12 months**. Not 1 day. Not 1 week.

**Today is about:**
- **Momentum** - Going 0 → 1
- **Foundation** - Dashboard + product + marketing
- **Psychology** - Proving you can ship

**Don't expect:**
- Overnight success
- Viral launch
- $100+ in first week

**Do expect:**
- Slow start (normal!)
- Learning curve
- Iteration needed
- Long-term compound growth

**You're laying the foundation today. That's the win.** 🚀
