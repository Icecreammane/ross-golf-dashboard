**Why this works:** Targets "best MyFitnessPal alternative" keyword naturally

---

### Question 2: "How is FitTrack different from other macro trackers?"
**Answer:** "Most macro trackers try to be everything: meal planners, recipe apps, social networks. FitTrack does one thing: track macros fast. Log food in 30 seconds, see daily totals at a glance, track progress. That's it. Built for lifters who know their macros and just want speed."

**Why this works:** Targets "simple macro tracker" and "fast macro tracking" keywords

---

---
