## ⚡ What Changed

**Plan vs Reality:**
- Sub-agent approach worked 80% (4/5 completed)
- 1 agent failed (rate limits) → manual build was faster anyway
- Total completion time: ~4 hours instead of 6+
- All objectives met or exceeded

**Key Learning:**
Sometimes manual execution beats delegation when you hit rate limits.
