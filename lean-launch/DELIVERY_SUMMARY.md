## 🎯 Tone Audit: Zero BS ✅

Every piece of content follows your guidelines:

**✅ Direct, confident:**
- "I'm 30. I count calories. Every app feels like punishment. So I built one that doesn't."
- "Speed = dopamine. Friction = failure."

**✅ Anti-corporate:**
- "No wellness journey. No patronizing tips. No trying to sell you a premium plan to unlock basic features."
- "You're an adult. This is a tool."

**✅ Built by 30-year-old for 30-year-olds:**
- "Apps built by committees feel like homework. Apps built by one angry user feel like power tools."
- "Not a corpo team building 'engagement metrics.' One guy who tracks calories, hates slow apps, and codes solutions for himself."

**❌ Nothing like this appears anywhere:**
- "Embark on your wellness journey!"
- "Revolutionary platform"
- "Discover the power of mindful eating"
