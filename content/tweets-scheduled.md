# Scheduled Tweets - Week 1

**Tweet 1: The Unlock**

Day 8 of building with AI.

Just realized: ChatGPT is a search engine.

But a local AI model on my Mac Mini running 24/7? That's a second brain that never sleeps.

Generates content, scans opportunities, prepares my morning brief - all while I'm asleep.

Cost: $0.

Mind = blown. 🤯

**Tweet 3: The Failure**

My local AI model timed out generating tweets today.

Took 10 minutes to debug and fix.

Some days the rain washes the bricks away.

That's building. 🧱

But the foundation gets stronger every day.

**Tweet 9: The Corporate Escape**

Current mission: $500 MRR by March 31.

Not because I need the money.

Because I need the proof.

Proof that I can build. Proof that people will pay. Proof that corporate isn't the only path.

Day 8. Still building.

The bricks are starting to stack. 🧱
