# 🏆 Daily Wins Tracker

**Built:** 2026-02-02 12:11 CST (during Ross's lunch break)

## What It Does

Simple, beautiful tracker for logging daily accomplishments. Perfect for building momentum and staying motivated.

**Features:**
- Quick-log wins by category (Fitness, Revenue, Personal, Work)
- Streak tracking (consecutive days with at least 1 win)
- Daily/weekly/all-time stats
- Beautiful animations and mobile-first design
- Stores locally in browser (no database needed)

## Why It Matters

Ties into "The Builder" story theme - track the empire being built one day at a time. Small wins compound into big progress.

**Psychology:**
- Logging wins = dopamine hit
- Seeing streaks = motivation to continue
- Visual progress = proof you're building

## Usage

**Mobile:** Same URL, fully responsive

**Quick Log:**
1. Select category
2. Type what you did
3. Hit Enter or click "Add Win"

**Categories:**
- 💪 Fitness (workout completed, meal logged, PR hit)
- 💰 Revenue (money made, project launched, sale closed)
- 🎯 Personal (goal achieved, habit built, lesson learned)
- 💼 Work (project delivered, problem solved, skill learned)

## Examples

**Fitness:** "Hit 5 workouts this week - new PR on bench press"  
**Revenue:** "First $100 from side project!"  
**Personal:** "Read for 30 minutes - finished chapter on goal setting"  
**Work:** "Shipped new feature ahead of schedule"

## The Compound Effect

Day 1: 1 win  
Week 1: 7+ wins  
Month 1: 30+ wins  
Year 1: 365+ wins

**That's an empire.**
