## DANGER ZONES (Watch Out For)

### Burnout 🔥
**Symptoms:** Working 16-hour days, skipping gym, ignoring friends  
**Solution:** Schedule breaks, maintain gym routine, talk to friends  
**Remember:** This is a marathon, not a sprint

### Feature Creep 🌀
**Symptoms:** Building features nobody asked for, scope expanding  
**Solution:** Only build what users explicitly request, stay minimal  
**Remember:** "No" is a feature

### Vanity Metrics 📊
**Symptoms:** Celebrating signups without checking conversions  
**Solution:** Focus on paid customers, not just trials  
**Remember:** Revenue > signups

### Negative Feedback Spiral 😞
**Symptoms:** One bad comment ruins your day, defensive replies  
**Solution:** Take criticism as free market research, stay professional  
**Remember:** You can't please everyone

---

## DECISION FRAMEWORK (30 Days)

### When deciding what to work on, ask:

**1. Will this increase revenue?**
- ✅ Yes → High priority
- ❌ No → Defer or skip

**2. Did users explicitly request this?**
- ✅ Multiple users → Build it
- ❌ Just you → Probably not

**3. Can I build this in <4 hours?**
- ✅ Yes → Quick win, do it
- ❌ No → Add to roadmap for later

**4. Will this reduce churn?**
- ✅ Yes → Critical priority
- ❌ No → Lower priority

**5. Is this essential for launch/survival?**
- ✅ Yes → Do it now
- ❌ No → Can wait
