## Energy Check

### Did she seem engaged or distracted?

**Signs she was distracted:**
- [ ] On phone frequently
- [ ] Short answers
- [ ] Looked around the room a lot

## Connection

**Did it feel natural or forced?**

- [ ] Natural (easy, flowing, few awkward silences)
- [ ] Forced (had to work hard to keep it going)

**What topics did you talk about?**
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Topic 3]

**Any awkward moments?**

**Final thought:**

Dating is a skill. Every date is practice, even the bad ones.

If it didn't, that's fine - you learned something and can move on.

Either way, you showed up. That's the hardest part.

**Keep going. 💪**
