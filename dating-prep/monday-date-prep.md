**Coffee/Casual:**
- **Frothy Monkey** (Downtown Nashville) - Great coffee, relaxed vibe
- **Barista Parlor** (Multiple locations) - Hip, good for conversation
- **Local coffee shop in Nolensville** - More low-key, less pressure

**Dinner/Drinks:**
- **The Pharmacy** (East Nashville) - Burgers + beer, casual but good

**Backup Plan Ideas:**

**Pro tip:** Have 2-3 backup spots in mind. Shows you're resourceful, not rigid.

## Conversation Starters

### 10 Open-Ended Questions (Not Interview-y)

**Hobbies/Interests:**
1. "What's something you're really into right now?" (not "what are your hobbies")
2. "If you had a free Saturday with no plans, what would you do?"
3. "What's the last thing that made you lose track of time?"

**Travel/Adventure:**
4. "What's your favorite trip you've ever taken?" (stories > yes/no)
5. "If you could live anywhere for a year, where would you pick?"

**Life/Goals:**
6. "What's something you're working toward right now?" (career, personal, fitness, etc.)
7. "What's changed for you in the last year?" (growth-focused)

**Fun/Lighthearted:**
8. "What's a weird skill or fact about you that surprises people?"
9. "What's your go-to comfort food?" (everyone loves talking about food)
10. "If you could master any skill overnight, what would it be?"

**Why these work:**
- Open-ended (can't answer with yes/no)
- Invite stories, not facts
- Reveal personality and values
- Easy to follow up on

## Topics to Explore

**Good territory:**
- Family (but don't drill - let her share)
- Career/passions (what lights her up?)
- Travel experiences
- Hobbies (fitness, cooking, reading, etc.)
- Future aspirations (what she's working toward)
- Fun preferences (music, movies, food)

**Green flags to watch for:**
- She asks you questions back (interested in you)
- She laughs easily (comfortable)
- She shares personal stories (trust/openness)
- She's present (not on phone constantly)
- She suggests future plans ("We should check that out!")

**Red flags to notice:**
- Talks only about herself (never asks about you)
- Constantly on phone
- Rude to servers/staff
- Only negative talk (complaining, drama)
- Pushes boundaries (physical, conversation)

---

## Topics to Avoid (First Date)

**Hard no's:**
- Politics (unless she brings it up and you agree)
- Religion (save for later if it matters)
- Exes (don't talk about yours, don't ask about hers)
- Money (don't flex, don't complain)
- Sex (unless she explicitly goes there)
- Heavy trauma/baggage (save for date 3+)

**Why:** First dates are about *chemistry and connection*, not deep compatibility. Keep it light, fun, positive.

---

## Mindset Reminders

### Before the Date:

**"She said yes because she's interested"**
- She didn't have to say yes. She chose to.
- She's nervous too (probably more than you)
- You're both checking if there's a vibe - that's the whole point

**"The goal is to have fun, not close the deal"**
- You're not trying to make her fall in love
- You're not trying to "win"
- You're just seeing if you enjoy each other's company
- Worst case: free practice in talking to women
- Best case: you meet someone cool

**"Be curious, not impressive"**
- Ask questions, listen to answers
- Don't try to one-up her stories
- Don't monologue about your achievements
- Genuine interest > trying to impress

**"Outcome independence"**
- If it goes great, awesome
- If it doesn't, that's fine too - not everyone clicks
- Either way, you showed up and tried
- You're practicing the skill of dating

---

## During the Date:

**Body language:**
- Maintain eye contact (but don't stare)
- Smile genuinely
- Lean in slightly when she talks (shows interest)
- Open posture (no crossed arms)
- Mirror her energy (if she's chill, be chill; if excited, match it)

**Conversation flow:**
- Ask question → Listen → Follow up → Share your own story → Repeat
- Don't interrogate (question after question)
- Don't monologue (talking for 5+ minutes straight)
- Balance: 50/50 talking vs listening

**Phone etiquette:**
- Put phone away (face down or in pocket)
- If you need to check it, say "sorry, expecting an important text" first
- If she's on her phone a lot = red flag

**Paying the bill:**
- Offer to pay (it's first date)
- If she insists on splitting, let her
- Don't make it awkward ("I got this, don't worry")

**Physical touch:**
- Start small if there's chemistry (light touch on arm when laughing)
- Read her body language (does she lean in or pull back?)
- End-of-date hug is safe
- Kiss only if it feels very natural (don't force it)

---

## After the Date:

**If it went well:**
- Text her that night or next morning: "Had a great time tonight! We should do it again."
- Reference something specific from the date ("Still thinking about that story about [X]")
- Suggest a second date within 3-5 days

**If it was meh:**
- Still text to thank her ("Thanks for coming out tonight, I appreciate it")
- Don't ghost - be honest if you're not feeling it
- "I had a nice time, but I didn't feel a romantic connection. Wish you the best!"

**If you're unsure:**
- Give it a day to process
- Sometimes chemistry grows on second dates
- If you're 60%+ interested, suggest seeing her again

---

## Emergency Exits

**If the date is going badly:**

1. **The polite exit:** "I have an early morning tomorrow, but this was nice. Take care!"
2. **The honest exit:** "I don't think we're clicking, but I appreciate you coming out."
3. **The safety exit:** Have a friend call you 30 mins in with a "fake emergency" (only if you feel unsafe)

**If you need a breather:**
- Go to the bathroom (collect yourself, check your vibe)
- Take 3 deep breaths
- Remind yourself: "This is just practice. I'm fine."

## Final Pep Talk

You've been lifting for 7 years. You've built businesses. You've handled harder things than a first date.

This is just two humans grabbing coffee/dinner and seeing if they vibe.

She's a person, not a test.

You're a person, not a performer.

Be yourself. Be present. Be curious.

If it goes well, great.

If it doesn't, you're still the same guy who's building cool shit and improving every day.

**You've got this. 💪**
