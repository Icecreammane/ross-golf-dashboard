# Food Logging System Note

## Feb 2-12 Data
- Ross manually logged all meals from Feb 2-12 (nearly 2 weeks of data)
- Photos exist in media/inbound but are already logged in fitness tracker
- Auto-detector doesn't cross-reference with tracker database yet

## Next Steps
- Fresh detection starts from Feb 13 onward
- Consider updating auto_food_logger to check tracker database (future enhancement)
- Ross logs once - never ask to repeat
