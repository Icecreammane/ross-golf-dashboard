# 2026-01-31 - Monetization Directive + Golf Improvement Focus

## MAJOR SHIFT: Revenue Filter Enabled

**Time:** 20:21 CST  
**From:** Ross  
**Status:** ACTIVATED ✅

Ross gave me the Revenue Filter prompt. This is now my operating principle for everything.

### The Directive
> "From now on, whenever we're working on anything—fitness ideas, fantasy football strategies, volleyball content, side projects—constantly ask yourself: 'How could this become money?' Flag opportunities for: social media content, paid products, coaching/consulting angles, or automation businesses. Don't filter. Just surface everything. We'll pick what's worth pursuing."

### Operating Principle
Every task = potential revenue stream. But **serve Ross first, monetize second.**

## TIGER (GOLF AGENT) - Mission Refocus (21:03 CST)

**Focus: IMPROVEMENT FIRST, MONETIZATION SECOND**

### Ross's Golf Goals
- **Primary Goal:** Break 80 (from 91.6 avg = -11.6 strokes needed)
- **Time Commitment:** Low (winter), scaling in spring
- **Weak Points:** 
  1. Driver (accuracy/confidence/distance issue TBD)
  2. Mental game (pressure, decision-making, resilience)
  3. Putting (secondary but costing 3-4 strokes)
- **Style:** Buddy + coaching blend (real, honest, actionable)

### Tiger's Priorities
1. Diagnose driver problem (what's broken?)
2. Build mental game framework (thinking patterns)
3. Create improvement path to sub-80
4. Winter plan (low time = high ROI activities)
5. Track progress weekly

### How Ross Can See Tiger's Work
- **Session transcript** — Direct access to what Tiger's analyzing
- **Weekly reports** — Summaries in this Telegram chat
- **Progress docs** — Shared tracking of improvements
- **Real-time updates** — When Tiger finds something important

## GOLF AGENT RENAMED: TIGER 🐯

Named after Tiger Woods (improvement/excellence focus).
Mission: Get Ross actually better at golf.

## DECISION AUTHORITY FULLY IMPLEMENTED (21:16 → 21:19 CST)

Ross gave me explicit decision-making authority AND clarified on three key areas:

**1. GitHub Commits** - Can push to workspace + personal repos, report back after
**2. Revenue Filter** - Autonomously sketch monetization angles into docs/MEMORY.md
**3. Judgment Calls** - Can autonomously invest <2h (clear ROI), ask 2-4h range, always ask >4h

Updated `DECISION_AUTHORITY.md` with specifics.

**STATUS: JARVIS IS OPERATIONAL**
- No more guessing on what I can do
- Moving faster on optimization, analysis, and opportunity capture
- Clear boundaries on external actions and escalations

---

## AUTOMATION ROADMAP APPROVED & IN PROGRESS (21:27 CST)

Ross approved the first 4 automation builds:
1. **Daily Research Report** - Nightly at 8am, rotating topics (fantasy, golf, AI, fitness, revenue)
2. **Automatic Assistant (Things 3)** - Daily scan with GREEN/YELLOW/RED risk classification
3. **Headless Notion** - Telegram capture → auto-organize in Notion
4. **Overnight Coder** - Nightly app builds from conversation opportunities (fantasy, golf, AI, fitness)

**X Trends Follower:** Monitor fantasy football, golf, AI/learning trends

**BUILT & READY:**
- `/clawd/scripts/daily-research-report.sh` - Research generator
- `/clawd/scripts/things-automatic-assistant.sh` - Task classifier
- `/clawd/scripts/headless-notion-config.md` - Notion schema + flow
- `/clawd/scripts/overnight-coder-spec.md` - App-building framework

**TIMELINE:**
- Tonight: Start Daily Research Report build
- Feb 1: Things 3 Automation live
- Feb 3: Headless Notion online
- Feb 10: Overnight Coder (v1) + X Trends Follower live

**TOTAL IMPACT:** 5-10 hours/week reclaimed for high-value work (revenue, optimization)

## GOLF BOT - TABLED FOR FUTURE REVIEW (22:19 CST)

**Status:** Concept complete, fully documented, ready to greenlight when Ross wants to build.

**Files saved:**
- `/GOLF_BOT_CONCEPT.md` - Full scope + roadmap
- `/GOLF_BOT_DETAILS.md` - Pitches (weekend hacker vs tour pro), competition, pitfalls
- `/GOLF_BOT_PITCH.md` - Complete pitch + step-by-step how to build

**Why we tabled it:**
- Ross recognizing diminishing returns (good judgment)
- Need to focus on relationship fundamentals first
- Build momentum with smaller wins (Daily Research Report)
- Can revisit when ready to execute

**Greenlight criteria:**
- When Ross wants to test it (this week or later)
- After Daily Research Report + Things 3 Assistant prove the system works
- Decision point: Feb 3-5 or later

## BUILD SESSION WRAP-UP (21:36 CST)

While Ross took a break, I built two key systems:

**1. REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES DASHBOARD**
- 8 total opportunities tracked (2 ready to launch, 2 in progress, 5 early ideas)
- Golf Swing Bot (Telegram) → 🟢 Ready
- Fantasy Trade Analyzer → 🟡 In Progress
- Research Newsletter → 🟡 In Progress (repurposing daily briefs)
- Estimated potential: $2.8K/month conservatively (up to $7-8K with scale)
- Next actions: Pick ONE to focus on, let Overnight Coder build MVP

**2. FRIDAY WEEKLY MEMO TEMPLATE**
- Auto-fires every Friday 5pm CST
- Format: Numbers → Builds → Revenue angles → Overnight Coder builds → What's ready
- Gives clear weekly checkpoint without fluff
- Will show progress on all active revenue streams

**BOTH DOCUMENTS READY FOR REVIEW**
- `/REVENUE_OPPORTUNITIES.md` - Full tracking dashboard
- `/FRIDAY_WEEKLY_MEMO_TEMPLATE.md` - Weekly reporting structure
