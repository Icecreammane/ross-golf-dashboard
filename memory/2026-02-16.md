## 🚀 Shipped
- ClawBack protocol implementation (git discipline, checkpoint/rollback)
- PRINCIPLES.md created with regression tracking
- Standup log format (60-line target)
- Checkpoint/rollback scripts (scripts/checkpoint.sh, scripts/rollback.sh)
- Reformed AGENTS.md with git discipline section

## 🚧 Blocked / In Progress
- Morning brief delivery (sent at 1:48pm, should be 7:30am daily)
- Evening check-in stale (last run Feb 11)
- Weekly report stale (last run Feb 8)

## 🎯 Next
- Make checkpoint/rollback scripts executable
- Commit ClawBack implementation (atomic commit)
- Test checkpoint before next risky operation
- Reform Feb 15 log to standup format (currently 207 lines)

## 💡 Key Decisions / Learnings
- **Adopted ClawBack:** Git discipline reduces token burn (207→60 line logs)
- **Opus API:** Don't use it - $75/M output vs $15/M for Sonnet (5x cost)
- **Cost optimization:** 3-tier routing already optimal, ClawBack adds token savings through smaller logs

## 📊 Stats
- Sessions: 1 (heartbeat + implementation)
- Token savings target: ~2K tokens/session via smaller logs
- Cost: $0 (no API usage yet today)

**Following ClawBack standup format: outcomes over process, ~60 lines max**
