# 2026-02-14 (Saturday)

## Morning Fixes (9:30 AM - 10:00 AM)
- Fixed cron job configuration in `~/.clawdbot/cron/jobs.json`
  - Issue: Jobs had `systemEvent: "HEARTBEAT"` but no `text` field
  - Gateway was calling `.trim()` on undefined, causing TypeError crashes
  - Solution: Added heartbeat prompt text to all cron jobs
- Switched primary model to local (Qwen 32B) but crashed due to MLX error
  - Reverted to Sonnet for stability
  - MLX issue: "Failed to load symbol: mlx_metal_device_info"
- Updated USER.md to note preference for local models when possible

## System Status
- Gateway: Running stable (PID 79080)
- Ollama: Running (PID 1139)
- Fitness Tracker: Running (PID 1412, port 3000)
- Disk space: 44% used (110GB free)

## Outstanding Items
- Evening check-in hasn't run since Feb 11 (heartbeat jobs now fixed)
- Security audit due tomorrow (Sunday 9 AM)
- Daily cost check overdue (last run Feb 12)
