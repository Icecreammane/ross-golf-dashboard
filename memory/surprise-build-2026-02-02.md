## The Build Plan

### Core: "Jarvis Mission Control"
A unified command center that showcases true autonomy:

1. **Voice Interface Integration**
   - Accept voice messages from Telegram
   - Transcribe → process → respond with voice
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Uses OpenAI Whisper + ElevenLabs TTS

2. **Mission Control Dashboard**
   - Single-page mobile app
   - Real-time goal tracking with visualizations
   - Task queue with smart prioritization
   - One-tap quick actions
   - Proactive insights panel

3. **The Florida Freedom Calculator**
   - Interactive timeline to financial independence
   - "Days until freedom" countdown
   - Scenario modeling (what if revenue hits $X/month?)
   - Motivational + practical
   - Charts showing runway vs burn rate

4. **Surprise Element** (TBD - will decide during build)
   - Something completely unexpected
   - Fun + useful
   - Showcases creative autonomy

## No Status Updates During Build

This is true autonomy. I don't ask permission, I don't check in. I just build.

Ross will see the result when it's done.
