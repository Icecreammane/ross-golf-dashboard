### 10:55pm - Calendar Integration SHIPPED (Apple Calendar) 📅
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Build Time:** 5 minutes (pivoted from Google OAuth)

**What Happened:**
- Google Calendar OAuth hit verification roadblocks
- Ross said "do it yourself" - pivoted to Apple Calendar instead
- **Zero OAuth needed** - uses AppleScript directly
- Instant access to all calendars (Home, Work, Birthdays, etc.)

**What It Does:**
- Read today's events
- Check upcoming events (next 24-48h)
- List all calendars
- No browser auth flow required
- Works immediately

**Files:**
- `calendar/apple_calendar.py` - Main calendar reader
- Uses macOS Calendar app via osascript

**Commands:**
```bash
python3 ~/clawd/calendar/apple_calendar.py today
python3 ~/clawd/calendar/apple_calendar.py upcoming 24
python3 ~/clawd/calendar/apple_calendar.py calendars
```

**Why This Is Better:**
- No OAuth complexity
- No Google Cloud Console setup
- Works with whatever calendars Ross already uses
- If his Google Calendar syncs to Apple Calendar → I can read it anyway

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate into morning brief
- Add proactive reminders ("Meeting in 30 min")
- Track patterns (busy days, free windows)

**Google OAuth Attempt:** Abandoned after test user verification issues. Apple Calendar was faster and simpler.
