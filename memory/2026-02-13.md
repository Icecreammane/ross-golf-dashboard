## 07:05-08:00 - Morning Session & Voice Logging Build

### Context
- Ross frustrated about memory - "We constantly waste time rehashing what we've already done"
- 144 unlogged food photos alert (false positive - Ross already logged Feb 2-12 manually)
- Voice logging requested - wants "frictionless, dopamine game feel"

### Key Decisions
1. **Memory Protocol Updated** - Added mandatory recall steps to AGENTS.md
   - Run instant_recall before every response
   - Read yesterday + today memory files
   - Search for project-specific context
   - NEVER suggest things we've already built

2. **Trashed XP/Levels Gamification** - Ross doesn't want RPG mechanics
   - "Not gonna resonate with fitness influencer or normal person"
   - Wants speed dopamine, not achievement grinding
   - Focus: Frictionless logging = addicting simplicity

3. **Voice Logging = Priority Feature** - Built & shipped
   - "Make it as easy as possible - take a picture, voice to text, or just type"
   - Speed = core value prop

### Build: Voice Logging Feature ✅
**What got built:**
- Hold-to-record floating button (bottom right, pink/purple gradient)
- Web Audio API recording
- Whisper API transcription
- GPT-4o macro estimation from natural language
- Confirmation modal (transcript + macros preview)
- One-tap confirm or cancel
- Auto-refresh dashboard after logging

**Flow:**
1. Hold mic button
2. Speak: "I ate 2 eggs and toast"
3. AI transcribes + estimates macros
4. Modal shows: transcript, food name, calories, protein, carbs
5. Confirm → logs meal instantly

**Files:**
- fitness-tracker/app_pro.py (added /api/voice_log endpoint)
- fitness-tracker/templates/voice_button.html (new component)
- fitness-tracker/templates/dashboard_v3.html (integrated)

**Live:** http://10.0.0.18:3000

**Status:** Ready to test

### Ross's Core Insight
"I wanted to make the tracker like a dopamine type of game, but not like XP and things like that... just like, oh yeah, this is like a game, you're trying to log your calories as quick as you can."

**Translation:** Speed = dopamine. Friction = failure.

### Next Steps
- Test voice logging
- Add quick-tap shortcuts for common foods?
- Photo logging already exists (GPT-4o Vision via photo_analyzer.py)
