# Daily Log - February 13, 2026

## 07:05-08:00 - Morning Session & Voice Logging Build

### Context
- Ross frustrated about memory - "We constantly waste time rehashing what we've already done"
- 144 unlogged food photos alert (false positive - Ross already logged Feb 2-12 manually)
- Voice logging requested - wants "frictionless, dopamine game feel"

### Key Decisions
1. **Memory Protocol Updated** - Added mandatory recall steps to AGENTS.md
   - Run instant_recall before every response
   - Read yesterday + today memory files
   - Search for project-specific context
   - NEVER suggest things we've already built

2. **Trashed XP/Levels Gamification** - Ross doesn't want RPG mechanics
   - "Not gonna resonate with fitness influencer or normal person"
   - Wants speed dopamine, not achievement grinding
   - Focus: Frictionless logging = addicting simplicity

3. **Voice Logging = Priority Feature** - Built & shipped
   - "Make it as easy as possible - take a picture, voice to text, or just type"
   - Speed = core value prop

### Build: Voice Logging Feature ✅
**What got built:**
- Hold-to-record floating button (bottom right, pink/purple gradient)
- Web Audio API recording
- Whisper API transcription
- GPT-4o macro estimation from natural language
- Confirmation modal (transcript + macros preview)
- One-tap confirm or cancel
- Auto-refresh dashboard after logging

**Flow:**
1. Hold mic button
2. Speak: "I ate 2 eggs and toast"
3. AI transcribes + estimates macros
4. Modal shows: transcript, food name, calories, protein, carbs
5. Confirm → logs meal instantly

**Files:**
- fitness-tracker/app_pro.py (added /api/voice_log endpoint)
- fitness-tracker/templates/voice_button.html (new component)
- fitness-tracker/templates/dashboard_v3.html (integrated)

**Live:** http://10.0.0.18:3000

**Status:** Ready to test

### Ross's Core Insight
"I wanted to make the tracker like a dopamine type of game, but not like XP and things like that... just like, oh yeah, this is like a game, you're trying to log your calories as quick as you can."

**Translation:** Speed = dopamine. Friction = failure.

### Next Steps
- Test voice logging
- Add quick-tap shortcuts for common foods?
- Photo logging already exists (GPT-4o Vision via photo_analyzer.py)


## 08:12 - Build/Feature
**Built:** Automatic memory system with pre-query and real-time logging
- Pre-query searches memory before every response
- Post-logging captures decisions/features immediately
- State tracking for conversation threads

## 08:12 - PERSISTENT MEMORY SYSTEM SHIPPED ✅

### The Problem
Ross: "I feel like we constantly waste time rehashing what we've already done. If you could just remember each session, that would really help us."

### The Solution
Built automatic memory system with:

**1. Pre-Query (Before Response)**
- Searches instant_recall for relevant memories
- Loads yesterday + today logs
- Detects mentioned projects
- Surfaces top 3 contexts automatically

**2. Real-Time Logging (After Response)**
- Captures decisions/features/preferences immediately
- Updates semantic search index
- Tracks conversation threads

**3. State Tracking**
- Maintains conversation history
- Links related discussions across time
- Counts context matches per query

### Files Built
- scripts/auto_memory.py (core engine)
- scripts/memory_wrapper.py (message interceptor)
- MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md (documentation)
- BUILD_PERSISTENT_MEMORY.md (build summary)
- memory/auto_memory_state.json (state tracking)

### Test Results
✅ Pre-query: Found FitTrack voice logging context from today + yesterday
✅ Post-log: Successfully logged to memory file
✅ Index: Updated semantic search
✅ State: Conversation thread tracked

### Next Step
Integrate into Clawdbot gateway as mandatory pre-processor.
Make memory recall non-optional.

### Impact
**End of rehashing.** Every session now starts with relevant context loaded automatically.

## 08:25 - "Lean" Goal Calculator - SHIPPED ✅

### Feature Request
Ross: "We should add to the calorie fitness tracker 'lean' a feature where you enter goals and it recommends target calories based on what you are trying to achieve"

### What Got Built
**Science-based goal calculator using Mifflin-St Jeor BMR formula**

**Inputs:**
- Current weight
- Goal weight
- Timeline (weeks)
- Activity level (sedentary → very active)
- Age
- Height

**Calculations:**
1. **BMR** (Basal Metabolic Rate) - Base calories burned at rest
2. **TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) - BMR × activity multiplier
3. **Required deficit/surplus** - (goal - current) × 3500 cal/lb
4. **Daily target** - TDEE ± daily deficit
5. **Protein recommendation** - 1g/lb for cutting, 0.8g/lb for maintenance

**Safety Checks:**
- Warns if rate >2 lbs/week (aggressive)
- Floors calories at 1500 minimum
- Shows weekly rate projection

**UI:**
- Floating "🎯 Set Goals" button (bottom left)
- Modal calculator with form
- Real-time calculation
- Shows: recommended calories, protein, TDEE, daily deficit, weekly rate
- One-tap "Save & Apply" updates dashboard targets

**API Endpoints:**
- POST /api/calculate_goals - Returns recommendations
- POST /api/save_goals - Saves to user_goals.json + updates dashboard

**Files:**
- fitness-tracker/app_pro.py (added 2 endpoints)
- fitness-tracker/templates/lean_calculator.html (new modal)
- fitness-tracker/templates/dashboard_v3.html (integrated)

**Live:** http://10.0.0.18:3000 → Click "🎯 Set Goals" (bottom left)

**Example Output:**
- Current: 225 lbs → Goal: 190 lbs (26 weeks)
- Moderate activity (3-5 days/week)
- Result: 2,458 cal/day, 225g protein, -1.35 lbs/week

### Why This Matters
No more guessing. Enter your goal → get exact calorie target backed by science.

## 08:27 - Build/Feature
**Lean Goal Calculator LIVE** ✅
- Science-based calorie targets using Mifflin-St Jeor BMR
- Input: weight, goal, timeline, activity level
- Output: recommended calories, protein, TDEE, weekly rate
- Safety checks for aggressive rates
- API tested: 225→190 lbs (26 weeks) = 2,480 cal/day, 225g protein
- UI: Floating "🎯 Set Goals" button (bottom left)
