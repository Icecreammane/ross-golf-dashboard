**Memory System Discussion:**

- Clear frustration with having to re-explain preferences and goals
- **Action taken:** Updated MEMORY.md and jarvis-journal.md with comprehensive context
- Committed to checking memory files before every response

## System Updates (Background)
Three sub-agents completed major builds today:
1. YouTube Transcript Reader - fully operational
2. Cron Automation System - scheduled tasks ready
3. Auto-Recovery System - self-healing infrastructure live

## Key Learnings

- Calorie goal: 2,200/day (protein 200g, carbs 250g, fat 70g)
- Publix subs are a regular dinner choice
- Memory retention is critical for better assistance

## Action Items
- [ ] Review MEMORY.md before every conversation
- [ ] Update memory files immediately when new preferences emerge
- [ ] Reference past conversations to show continuity
- [ ] Never ask questions I should already know
