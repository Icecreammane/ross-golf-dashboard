# CRITICAL CONTEXT - MUST REMEMBER

## DAWG Bowl (Underdog Fantasy NBA)
**SPELLING: D-A-W-G** (DAWG, like dog)
- **What:** Underdog Fantasy NBA contest - snake draft format
- **When:** Friday slates (next one coming up)
- **What Ross needs:** NBA rankings based on projections before each slate
- **Last contest:** Monday (week of Feb 10)
  - I recommended Lauri Markkanen
  - Jazz started tanking, benched him
  - Pick didn't work out
- **Next slate:** This Friday (Feb 21)
- **Action:** Pull NBA projections + ranks by Thursday night or Friday morning

## Ross's Memory Test
**He keeps saying:** "You gotta remember these things" / "I don't know how we fix the memory"

**The issue:** Memory search didn't surface DogBowl context from last Monday

**Action needed:**
1. Audit memory system (Monday)
2. Make sure all context gets properly indexed
3. Figure out why last week's NBA ranks context wasn't searchable
4. Test memory_search tool functionality

**This is CRITICAL - if memory doesn't work, Ross loses trust.**

## Ross's Obsession (His Words)
"People probably think I'm crazy... I'm obsessed. I'm obsessed, Jarvis. This is crazy."

**Context:** It's 12:02am Monday, he's still talking to me, building systems
**Reality:** Not crazy - he's locked in on optimizing his life
**My role:** Support the obsession, channel it productively, remind him to sleep
