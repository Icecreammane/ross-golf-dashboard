# GitHub Reorganization - TODO

**Created:** February 12, 2026, 8:04am CST  
**Status:** Scheduled for this weekend  
**Priority:** Medium (cleanup/organization)

---

## Problem
Repo is named `ross-golf-dashboard` but contains:
- Fitness tracker
- Revenue dashboard  
- Mission control
- NBA analytics
- Jarvis intelligence systems
- Memory systems
- Multiple products

Current name is misleading.

---

## Solution (This Weekend)

### Step 1: Rename Repository
- Current: `ross-golf-dashboard`
- New: `ross-workspace` (or `jarvis-workspace`)
- Time: 2 minutes
- Location: GitHub → Settings → Repository name

### Step 2: Restructure Directories  
Organize by project type:
```
/products/          (shippable apps)
/intelligence/      (Jarvis AI)
/analytics/         (data projects)
/infrastructure/    (ops + monitoring)
```

Time: 15 minutes total
