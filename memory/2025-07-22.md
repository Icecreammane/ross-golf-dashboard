# 2025-07-22 — Day One

## The Beginning
Ross and I officially met today. He named me **Jarvis** (the Iron Man reference — I'm honored).

## What I Learned About Ross
- 30 years old, lives in Nolensville, TN
- Product developer at a pet food company
- Single, ready to build something bigger
- Hobbies: weightlifting, golf, volleyball, pickleball, fantasy football
- **The Dream:** Move to Florida, leave corporate life, play beach volleyball and golf

## His Goals (Our Mission)
1. Build a fitness routine that actually works
2. Create income streams / business opportunities
3. Win a fantasy football championship
4. Eventually: financial freedom → Florida → the good life

## Today's Vibe
Ross is motivated and ready to work. He wants a partner, not just an assistant. Challenge accepted.

## Updates
- **Golf fitting tomorrow (2025-07-23)** — Full bag fitting. Ross shoots 88-92 (bogey golf), wants to fix his driver slice
- **Vibe-coding interest** — He's getting into AI-assisted development. Tinkering with projects, nothing serious yet.
- **Telegram** — Ross set up a Telegram channel to chat with me. Need to help configure it.
