# 2026-02-07 - Daily Log

## System Health
- **04:01 CST** - Heartbeat check: Gateway was not running (last shutdown Feb 4)
- Reinstalled LaunchAgent service (`clawdbot gateway install`)
- Gateway now running (pid 22319) ✅
- No alerts in alert-pending.json
- Fitness tracker port 3000 not responding (secondary issue)

## Autonomous Activity
- Ran proactive research (scheduled autonomy window: 11pm-7am)
  - Beach volleyball Florida research ✅
  - NBA underdog rankings ✅
  - Florida relocation opportunities ✅
  - Side project marketing insights ✅
- Autonomous task generation ran - queue has 3 pending tasks, no spawn (quiet hours)

## Status
- System operational after gateway recovery
- Morning brief will trigger at 7:30am CST
- No blocking issues

## Autonomous Build System - FIXED! 🎉
**09:42 CST** - Ross asked: "Why don't things build autonomously?"

**Root cause:** autonomous_check.py was only logging intentions, never actually spawning builds.

**Solution implemented:**
1. Modified autonomous_check.py to write spawn signals to `memory/spawn-signal.json`
2. Updated HEARTBEAT.md protocol to detect spawn signals and act on them
3. Spawning happens via `sessions_spawn` tool (agent-level, not CLI)

**First autonomous build spawned:** 09:44 CST
- Task: Test Build - Simple Echo
- Session: b0c165a9-2fb1-49f4-b9b5-19145a8bfd52
- ETA: 35 minutes
- Est. Cost: $0.49
- Expected completion: 10:19 AM CST

**Status:** ✅ Autonomous builds now fully operational!

## Workflow Optimizations - Weekend Build Plan 🚀
**10:04 CST** - Ross: "Let's improve workflow and make you more autonomous"

**Approved for this weekend:**

### 1. ✅ Trusted Actions (DONE)
- Auto-commit/push permissions enabled
- Scope: memory, docs, build outputs, generated content
- Code changes still require review
- Updated: TOOLS.md

### 2. 🔄 Proactive Content Pipeline (Tonight)
- Overnight tweet generator (7 drafts/week)
- Stored in `content/tweets-pending/`
- Morning approval flow (👍/👎)
- Ships with morning brief

### 3. 🔄 Smart Calendar Prep (Tomorrow)
- Google Calendar API integration
- Auto-generate event briefs (who/why/prep)
- Deliver in morning summary
- 24h lookahead

### 4. ✅ Hybrid Model Strategy (DONE)
- **Opus** for revenue builds (Stripe, landing pages, conversions)
- **Sonnet** for everything else (content, automation, dashboards)
- Auto-detection via keywords in autonomous_check.py
- Documented: MODEL_STRATEGY.md

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- Sonnet: $0.50-1/build, might need 2-3 tries
- Opus: $3-5/build, works first time
- **Decision:** Use Opus where quality = revenue impact

**Files Updated:**
- `scripts/autonomous_check.py` - Model selection logic
- `MODEL_STRATEGY.md` - Strategy documentation  
- `HEARTBEAT.md` - Spawn with model parameter
- `TOOLS.md` - Trusted actions expanded

**Status:** Hybrid strategy live. Next revenue build will auto-use Opus.

## Expanded Model Roster - The Coding Arms 🤖
**10:27 CST** - Ross: "Use Codex as the coding arms, also Gemini and Grok APIs for certain tasks"

**Enterprise Structure:**
```
Ross (CEO - Sets Direction)
  │
  └─ Jarvis (Chief of Staff - Delegates & Coordinates)
       │
       ├─ Codex (Lead Engineer - Production Coding)
       ├─ Opus (Chief Strategist - Deep Reasoning)
       ├─ Sonnet (Workhorse - Content & Tasks)
       ├─ Gemini (Analyst - Multimodal & Research)
       └─ Grok (Scout - Real-Time Intel)
```

**Model Assignments:**
- **Codex** → All production coding (APIs, Stripe, dashboards, features)
- **Opus** → Strategic planning, architecture, deep reasoning
- **Sonnet** → Content generation, docs, quick tasks (default)
- **Gemini** → Multimodal (images, video, PDF analysis, large docs)
- **Grok** → Real-time social/web data (Twitter trends, sentiment)

**Smart Routing Logic:**
- "Build Stripe integration" → Codex
- "Create landing page strategy" → Opus
- "Generate tweet drafts" → Sonnet
- "Analyze this screenshot" → Gemini
- "What's trending on Twitter?" → Grok

**Files Created:**
- `MODEL_ROSTER.md` - Full guide and routing logic
- Updated `autonomous_check.py` - Smart model selection

**Mission Control V2:**
- Spawned at 10:23 CST with Opus
- Building real command center (not org chart)
- ETA: 2-3 hours
- Will become single source of truth

**Status:** ✅ Coding arms structure live. Each specialist handles their domain.

## 6:04pm - Dashboard LIVE! ✅
- Built unified dashboard (index.html + data_aggregator.py)
- 3-column layout: system status, operations, goals
- Dark theme, auto-refresh every 60s
- Server running on http://10.0.0.18:8081
- Ross confirmed: "It works!"
- **Time:** 15 minutes (5:55pm-6:10pm... but took a few server restarts to fix port issue)
- **Status:** LIVE and functional
