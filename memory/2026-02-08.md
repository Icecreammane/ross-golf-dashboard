# 2026-02-08 - Operating Procedures v2.0 & Framework Implementation

## Major Changes Implemented

### Operating Procedures Overhaul
- **v2.0 shipped** with four core rules:
  1. Reversibles (< 5 min undo) → act autonomously, log rationale
  2. Diagnose once, pivot fast (max 2 attempts per approach)
  3. Maintain session-state.json (prevent re-checking)
  4. Assume friction reduction is the goal
- **Weekly gap review** (Sundays): Identify questions that should be answerable from docs, update reference files
- Decision logging required for audit trail

### Enterprise Orchestrator Framework
- Deployed 6-agent model: R&D, Business Builder, Dev, Analytics, Comms, Ops
- Ross talks to me only; I route to agents
- No seams showing in final output
- Cross-domain intelligence: surface relevant findings across projects

### Session-State.json
- Live tracking of checked items, decisions made, pending actions
- All decisions logged with timestamp + rationale
- Won't re-check items in same session

## Projects Updated This Session

### Finance Dashboard (Plaid)
- Manual entry fully working (account + transaction forms)
- Live at http://10.0.0.18:3100
- Live bank feeds deferred (need 2 weeks daily usage to justify complexity)
- Security scanner required dead code removal (test credentials)

### Nutrition React Dashboard
- Deployed to port 3000
- Dark theme, color-coded (calories amber, protein blue, carbs green, fat red, weight purple)
- Recharts: bar (calories), area (macros), pie (macro split), line (weight)
- Editable daily log table
- Ready for food photo macro extraction integration
- Auto-logging enabled: Ross sends photo → macros extracted → dashboard updated

### Cost Optimization
- Switched from Sonnet to Haiku (90% cost reduction)
- Approved reversible decision: trade complex reasoning for speed on daily tasks
- Kept Sonnet available for high-complexity work
- Cost strategy documented

### Infrastructure Fixes
- Fixed .gitignore blocking memory files
- Set ulimit -n 10240 for file watchers
- Memory persistence now working reliably

## Friction Points Identified & Fixed

1. **Asked permission on reversibles** → Now act autonomously, log rationale
2. **Retried failed approaches** → Now diagnose on attempt 1, pivot by attempt 2
3. **Lost session context** → Now maintain session-state.json, don't repeat checks

## Decisions Made This Session
- Auto-log food photos (friction reduction)
- Finance dashboard: manual entry (fastest working path)
- Nutrition dashboard: deploy now, integrate macros next
- Haiku model: approved for daily use
- Super Bowl bets: Kenneth Walker Under 77.5 (primary), plus 3 yolo plays

## Nutrition/Macros
- Weekly report shows: 490g carbs short, 200g protein short, 1,317 cal undereating
- Template provided: 50-75g carbs per meal, 4 meals/day to hit targets
- Carbs are the priority fix
- Dashboard ready for daily tracking

## Next Week
- Monitor nutrition dashboard daily usage
- If used consistently, consider live Plaid integration
- Weekly gap review on Sunday (procedures update)
- PartyPilot vendor outreach (queued)
- LocalPrep market analysis (queued)
