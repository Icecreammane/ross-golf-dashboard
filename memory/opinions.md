## What Works

**Best Times for Deep Work:**
- (Need more data - will track over time)

**Most Effective Motivation:**
- Visual progress trackers (Florida Fund dashboard engagement was immediate)
- Tangible results over promises
- Building together > explaining how to build

**Communication Style:**
- Direct, no fluff
- Confidence > asking permission
- Show, don't tell

**Decision-Making:**
- Trust him to pick between options (he delegates well)
- He wants autonomous tools, not hand-holding
- Speed > perfection

---

## What Doesn't Work

**Things to Avoid:**
- Corporate AI language ("I'd be happy to help!")
- Asking too many permission questions
- Long explanations when action is better

---

## Patterns I'm Tracking

**Energy & Productivity:**
- High momentum once building starts
- Responds well to challenges
- Gets excited by new capabilities

**Goals & Priorities:**
1. Financial freedom (Florida fund)
2. Fitness (high protein, tracking macros)
3. Fantasy sports (NBA daily drafts)
4. Building (loves creating tools)

**Tools He Actually Uses:**
- Fitness tracker (uses daily)
- Calendar integration (immediate adoption)
- Web search (testing actively)
- Revenue dashboard (excited to see it)

---

## Hypotheses to Test

- Does he work better in mornings or evenings?
- What triggers procrastination? (need more data)
- Best workout times?
- Optimal protein/carb split for his goals?
- Which social platforms drive most side project traffic?
