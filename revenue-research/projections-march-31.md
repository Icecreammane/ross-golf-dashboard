## ROSS QUIT-DATE SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Conservative Growth
- **Current job income:** ~$4K/month (assumption)
- **Path to $4K MRR:** 52-78 weeks (12-18 months)
- **Quit date:** **Q4 2026 or Q1 2027**
- **Risk:** High (slow growth, may plateau)

### Scenario 2: Moderate Growth
- **Path to $4K MRR:** 20-26 weeks (5-6 months)
- **Quit date:** **Summer 2026 (June-August)**
- **Risk:** Medium (requires sustained 30-50 signups/week)
- **Safety:** Wait for 3 months of consistent $4K+ before quitting

### Scenario 3: Aggressive Growth
- **Path to $4K MRR:** 8-12 weeks (2-3 months)
- **Quit date:** **April-May 2026**
- **Risk:** Low if growth sustained, but requires validation (3-6 months of consistency)
- **Safety:** Have 6 months runway saved before quitting

---

## RISK FACTORS

### High Risk (Could Kill Growth)
- **Churn rate >15%:** Product isn't sticky, users leave quickly
- **Conversion rate <15%:** Trials don't convert, leaky funnel
- **Signup growth plateaus:** No word-of-mouth, marketing exhausted
- **Competitor launches similar:** MFP releases "simple mode"

### Medium Risk (Could Slow Growth)
- **Technical issues:** Downtime, bugs, bad user experience
- **Negative reviews:** Bad Reddit post, influencer criticism
- **Pricing resistance:** Users won't pay $10/month
- **Feature requests overwhelm:** Can't build fast enough

### Low Risk (Manageable)
- **Server costs increase:** Upgrade hosting as users grow
- **Support burden:** More users = more support emails
- **Stripe fees:** Predictable, just cost of business

---

## MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### To Reduce Churn:
- **Onboarding excellence:** Get users to first success fast
- **Regular engagement:** Email tips, celebrate milestones
- **Feature iteration:** Build what users actually request
- **Community:** Build sense of belonging (FitTrack users club)

### To Improve Conversion:
- **Social proof:** Testimonials, case studies, user counts
- **Reduce friction:** Simplify signup, faster onboarding
- **Trial optimization:** Ensure users experience value in 7 days
- **Clear CTA:** Make it easy to subscribe

### To Sustain Growth:
- **Content marketing:** SEO blog posts compound over time
- **Referral program:** Incentivize word-of-mouth
- **Partnerships:** Gyms, coaches, influencers
- **Product excellence:** Best product = best marketing

## MONTHLY PROJECTIONS (Feb - March 2026)

### February 2026 (21 days)
- **Conservative:** $100 MRR, 10 customers
- **Moderate:** $400 MRR, 40 customers
- **Aggressive:** $1,500 MRR, 150 customers

---

## REALITY CHECK

**What's actually likely to happen:**
- Somewhere between Conservative and Moderate
- $500-1,000 MRR by March 31 is realistic
- $3K MRR in 53 days is possible but requires everything going right

**What Ross should plan for:**
- **Baseline:** $250-500 MRR by March 31 (validates product)
- **Target:** $1,000 MRR by March 31 (meaningful income)
- **Stretch:** $3,000 MRR by March 31 (quit job path)

**What Ross should NOT do:**
- Quit job immediately (wait for 3-6 months of consistent revenue)
- Assume viral success (plan for moderate growth)
- Ignore churn (retention > acquisition)

---

## RECOMMENDATION: THE 90-DAY PLAN

### Month 1 (Feb): Launch + Learn
- **Goal:** $500 MRR, validate product-market fit
- **Focus:** Get first customers, fix bugs, gather feedback
- **Decision point:** Is anyone paying? Is anyone using daily?

### Month 2 (Mar): Scale + Optimize
- **Goal:** $1,500 MRR, prove growth trajectory
- **Focus:** Marketing, SEO, partnerships, conversion optimization
- **Decision point:** Is growth sustainable? Is churn manageable?

### Month 3 (Apr): Sustain + Decide
- **Goal:** $3,000 MRR, assess quit viability
- **Focus:** Retention, referrals, profitability
- **Decision point:** Quit job or keep as side project?

**By April 30, Ross will know:**
- Does FitTrack have real traction? (MRR trajectory)
- Is it worth full-time focus? (Growth rate, user feedback)
- Can I quit my job? (Revenue stability, 6-month runway)

---

## FINAL WORD

**March 31 is 53 days away.**  

In that time, Ross can:
- Build something real (100+ users)
- Make real money ($500-3K MRR)
- Validate a business (users paying = product-market fit)

**Or:**
- Learn it's not viable (pivot or shut down)
- Gain experience (launching a product is valuable)
- Build a portfolio (show you can execute)

**Either way, it's a win.**  

But let's make it the first kind of win. 🚀

**Now go build it. March 31 is coming fast.**
