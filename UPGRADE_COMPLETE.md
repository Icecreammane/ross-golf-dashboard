bash ~/clawd/scripts/jarvis_quick.sh dashboard
# → Opens at http://localhost:8080/org-chart-dashboard.html

# Control builds
bash ~/clawd/scripts/jarvis_quick.sh pause     # Stop spawning
bash ~/clawd/scripts/jarvis_quick.sh resume    # Resume spawning
bash ~/clawd/scripts/jarvis_quick.sh spawn     # Force spawn now

# Monitor costs
bash ~/clawd/scripts/jarvis_quick.sh cost      # Today
bash ~/clawd/scripts/jarvis_quick.sh week      # This week

# See all commands
bash ~/clawd/scripts/jarvis_quick.sh help
```

### Make It Even Faster (Optional)
