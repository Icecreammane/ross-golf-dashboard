**Target: Friend Network + Local Partnership Opportunities**  
**Created:** 2026-02-07 03:16 CST

## STRATEGY OVERVIEW

**Why Local Matters:**
- Face-to-face credibility > online marketing
- Word-of-mouth from real people > ads
- Nashville has thriving fitness scene (CrossFit, powerlifting, climbing)
- Ross's personal network = warm leads, not cold outreach

**Goal:** 10-20 early customers from Nashville connections before going national

## TIER 1: ROSS'S IMMEDIATE NETWORK (Highest Priority)

### Gym Buddies / Training Partners
**Who:** People Ross lifts with regularly  
**Why they're perfect:** Already know Ross trains seriously, trust his judgment  
**Pitch Approach:** "Hey, I built a macro tracker because MFP sucks. You track macros, right? Want to be a beta tester?"

**Action Items:**
- [ ] List 10 gym friends who track macros
- [ ] Send personal text/DM (not generic message)
- [ ] Offer lifetime discount for being first users

---

### Workout Class Friends (CrossFit, climbing, etc.)
**Who:** People Ross sees regularly but doesn't train with directly  
**Why they're good:** Social proof ("Ross built this"), fitness-focused  
**Pitch Approach:** Mention casually in conversation, gauge interest, follow up

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Identify 5-10 people from classes/gym community
- [ ] Natural conversation (not forced sales pitch)
- [ ] "I'm launching this Friday, want early access?"

**Expected Conversion:** 2-3 signups (20-30%)

---

### Fitness Friends from Social Media
**Who:** People Ross follows/interacts with on Instagram/Twitter who are Nashville-based  
**Why they're warm leads:** Already connected online, mutual interest in fitness  
**Pitch Approach:** DM with personalized message referencing their content

**Template:**
```
"Hey [name], saw your recent post about [specific workout/nutrition thing]. 

I'm launching FitTrack this Friday - built it because I was tired of MFP's bloat. You seem like someone who'd appreciate simple macro tracking.

```

**Action Items:**

## PARTNERSHIP PITCH FRAMEWORK

### Gym Owner/Manager Outreach Template

**Subject:** Offer for [Gym Name] Members: Simple Macro Tracker

**Body:**
```
Hi [Owner/Manager Name],

I'm Ross, a Nashville-based lifter and developer. I built FitTrack - a macro tracking app specifically for serious lifters (because MyFitnessPal is bloated and Cronometer is overkill).

I'm launching this Friday and want to offer [Gym Name] members a partnership discount:

• 20% off for your members (exclusive code)
• I'll promote your gym to my network in return
• Flyers/posters if you want them (I'll design + print)
• No cost to you, just a value-add for your members

Would you be open to a quick call this week? I train at [Ross's gym] and know how valuable community recommendations are.

Best,
Ross

P.S. - Here's what FitTrack looks like: [link to screenshots]
```

**Follow-Up Actions:**
- [ ] Email 5-10 gyms this week
- [ ] Offer to visit in person (better conversion)
- [ ] Create partnership one-pager (PDF flyer)
- [ ] Design gym poster (QR code → free trial)

**Expected Conversion:** 2-3 partnerships from 10 outreaches (20-30%)

---

### Partnership Benefits (For Gyms)

**What gyms get:**
- Free value-add for members (builds goodwill)
- Exclusive discount code (makes members feel special)
- Potential small commission (if they want - 10% of referrals?)
- Cross-promotion (Ross mentions gym on social)

**What Ross gets:**
- Credibility (local gym endorsement)
- Warm leads (gym members trust gym recommendations)
- Physical presence (poster/flyer in gym = visibility)
- Community building (Nashville fitness scene buy-in)

**Win-win positioning:** Not a sales pitch, a community offer

---

## TIER 3: NASHVILLE FITNESS INFLUENCERS

### Micro-Influencers (1K-10K followers, Nashville-based)

**How to find them:**
1. Instagram search: `#NashvilleFitness` + `#NashvilleGym` + `#FitNashville`
2. Look for consistent macro-tracking content
3. Check engagement rate (10%+ = good)
4. Verify they're actual Nashville residents (not national accounts)

**Outreach Approach:**
- DM (not email - more personal)
- Reference specific content ("Loved your post about [X]")
- Offer free lifetime access in exchange for honest review
- No pressure - "only if you actually like it"

**Template:**
```
"Hey [name], 

Nashville lifter here - saw your post about [specific thing]. Really resonated.

I just launched FitTrack (macro tracker for people tired of MFP's bloat). Would you be open to trying it? 

Free lifetime access, zero obligation. If you like it and want to share with your audience, cool. If not, no worries - just want feedback from someone who actually knows their stuff.

[Link]"
```

**Target:** 10-15 micro-influencers, 2-3 post about it organically

---

## TIER 4: ONLINE COMMUNITIES (NASHVILLE-SPECIFIC)

### Facebook Groups
- "Nashville Fitness & Health"
- "Nashville CrossFit Community"
- "Nashville Powerlifting"
- "Nashville Climbers"

**Approach:**
- Join groups (if Ross isn't already in them)
- Participate authentically (don't immediately pitch)
- Wait for "recommend a macro tracker" thread
- Comment genuinely: "I built FitTrack for this exact reason..."

**DON'T:** Post unsolicited ads (will get banned)  
**DO:** Add value, build reputation, mention when relevant

---

### Reddit (Nashville-specific)
- r/nashville (careful - strict self-promotion rules)
- Post on "Self-Promo Sunday" if allowed
- Focus on being a Nashville local building a product

---

## TIER 5: NASHVILLE TECH/STARTUP SCENE

### Why This Matters
Nashville has growing tech scene - good for:
- Beta testers (tech-savvy users give better feedback)
- Word-of-mouth in startup community
- Potential investors/advisors (if scaling later)

### Where to Connect
- Nashville Entrepreneur Center events
- Nashville Software School alumni
- HCA Healthcare tech employees (huge Nashville employer)
- Vanderbilt/Belmont tech/entrepreneur clubs

**Approach:** Attend 1-2 events, network naturally, mention FitTrack when asked "what are you working on?"

## NOTES FOR ROSS

**Local-first advantages:**
- Face-to-face credibility (people see you at the gym)
- Word-of-mouth spreads fast in tight communities
- Nashville pride ("support local" mentality)
- Easier to get honest feedback (not just online comments)

**Don't underestimate:** Your personal network is worth more than 1000 Twitter followers. 10 friends who genuinely love FitTrack will tell 100 people. That's how you bootstrap.

**Be authentic:** Don't be a "sales guy" to your friends. Be Ross who built a cool thing and wants feedback. The money will follow if the product is good.

**Next Step:** Text 5 gym friends TODAY. "Hey, I built a macro tracker. Want to try it?" That's your first 5 customers right there.
