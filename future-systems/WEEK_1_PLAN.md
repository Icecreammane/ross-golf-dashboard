---

## Day 1: Friday, February 7 - ACTIVATION DAY

### Morning (7:30-12:00 PM): System Activation
- Read morning brief
- Activate all three systems
- Test each independently
- Send first outreach batch (10 messages)

### Afternoon (12:00-6:00 PM): First Real Usage
- Log every action you take
- Use voice commands naturally (5+ times)
- Track any outreach replies

### Evening: Review
- Check pattern tracker logs
- Review voice command usage
- Check outreach dashboard
- Note: What worked? What felt clunky?

**Goal:** All systems active and logging data

---

## Day 2: Saturday, February 8 - BUILD HABIT

### Morning
- [ ] Check yesterday's patterns: `python3 accountability/pattern_analyzer.py 1`

## Day 7: Thursday, February 13 - WEEK 1 COMPLETE

### Morning: Full Week Analysis
- [ ] **Full week pattern report**: `python3 accountability/pattern_analyzer.py 7`

- [ ] **Voice command usage review**: Check logs

### Work Session
- [ ] Send final batch #7 (10 messages)
- [ ] Log everything as usual
- [ ] Use voice commands naturally

### Afternoon: Evolution Check
- [ ] Check if ready to evolve: `python3 sales/evolution_engine.py`
- [ ] If ready (70+ sends), generate Generation 2 variations

### Evening: Week 1 Review

## Milestones

### Day 1
🎯 Systems activated

### Day 3
📊 First patterns emerging

### Day 5
🔍 50 sends = learning threshold

### Day 7
🏆 Week 1 complete, systems established

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### "I forgot to log actions"
**Solution:** Set hourly reminder for first week. After 7 days, it becomes automatic.

### "Voice commands feel awkward"
**Solution:** Stick with it for 5 days. Awkward → Natural around day 4-5.

### "Not getting enough replies to learn"
**Solution:** Focus on sending volume. Need 50+ sends. Reply rate will vary but patterns emerge with volume.

### "Too much data to track"
**Solution:** Systems do the tracking. You just log actions. Analysis is automated.
