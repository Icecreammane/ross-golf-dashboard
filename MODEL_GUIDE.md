```
Is it conversation with Ross? → Jarvis (Sonnet)
Is it routine monitoring? → Local Brain (FREE)
Is it a 2+ hour build? → Builder (Opus)
Is it complex technical? → Code Expert (Codex)
Is it content generation at 2am? → Local Brain (FREE)
```

## 📱 What You See vs What's Happening

**When you text me "Ship it all":**

**You see:**
- Me responding instantly
- "Build session launched!"
- Updates when things complete

**Behind the scenes:**
1. Jarvis (me, Sonnet) reads your message ($0.10)
2. Jarvis spawns Builder (Opus) with instructions ($0.50)
3. Builder works for 3 hours building everything ($8)
4. Builder tells Jarvis when done ($0.20)
5. Jarvis tells you "It's done!" ($0.20)

**Total:** ~$9 for 3 hours of work

## 💡 The Smart Part

**We use the cheapest model that can do the job well:**

- Checking disk space? → Local Brain (FREE) ✅
- Chatting with Ross? → Jarvis/Sonnet ($) ✅
- Building 6 systems? → Builder/Opus ($$) ✅
- NOT using Opus for "how's the weather?" ❌
- NOT using Sonnet for routine monitoring ❌

**Result:** You get capable AI without burning $100/day

## 🎮 Game Analogy

**Local Brain** = NPCs doing background tasks (mining, farming)  
**Jarvis (me)** = Your character you control and talk to  
**Builder/Opus** = Hired mercenary for big quests  
**Code Expert/Codex** = Specialist you call for boss fights

All working together to level you up! 🚀

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: Why not just use the best model for everything?**  
A: Opus costs 10x more than Sonnet. Using it for "Good morning!" would burn $100/day.

**Q: Can I talk to the other models?**  
A: Nope! You only talk to me (Jarvis/Sonnet). I coordinate the others.

**Q: How do I know which one is working?**  
A: I'll tell you! "Spawning builder..." or "Local brain found this..."

**Q: Can I turn off the expensive ones?**  
A: Yes! Just tell me "No builds today" and I won't spawn Opus/Codex.

**Q: Why do we need Local Brain if you exist?**  
A: I'm expensive to run 24/7. Local Brain does boring stuff for free while you sleep.
