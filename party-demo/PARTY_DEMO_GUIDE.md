## What's Built

Two interactive demos perfect for volleyball players who barely use AI:

### 2. 💬 Ask Me Anything (BACKUP)
**File:** `ask_anything.html`  
**What it does:** Ask any question, get smart AI answer instantly

**Why it'll land:**

- "Should I bet on the over/under?"
- "What's the best protein for muscle gain?"
- "Explain quantum physics in simple terms"

## 🎭 The Demo Strategy

### Phase 1: Casual (During Game)
- Don't announce anything
- Use "Ask Me Anything" naturally when questions come up
- "Yo let me check that" → type → instant expert answer
- Do this 2-3 times organically
- Build curiosity

### Phase 2: The Reveal (Halftime/Commercial)
- Someone asks "how are you getting these answers so fast?"
- "That's AI. Want to see something funnier?"
- Pull out Roast Bot
- Take photo of someone
- Show the roast
- "Your turn"

### Phase 3: Let Them Play (2nd Half)
- Hand them your phone with Roast Bot open
- They take photos of each other
- Everyone wants a turn
- You just watch the chaos

## 📱 Setup Before Party

### Option A: Just Web (Easiest)
1. Open both HTML files in Safari on your phone
2. Bookmark them for quick access
3. Done - you're ready

### Option B: Telegram Bot (Advanced)
- If you want them to use it themselves
- Follow `TELEGRAM_SETUP.md`
- Requires Telegram Bot + OpenAI API
- Budget $5-10 for full party usage

**Recommendation: Start with Option A (web), upgrade to B if they go crazy for it**

---

## 💰 Costs (If Using Real AI)

- **Ask Me Anything:** ~$0.01-0.02 per question
- **Roast Bot:** ~$0.01-0.03 per roast
- **Party Budget:** $5-10 total (plenty for a full party)

**Current version uses mock responses (free), can connect to real AI later**

## 🎯 What to Say

### If they ask "How does this work?"
> "It's AI - uses computer vision to analyze photos and GPT-4 to write roasts. Same tech as ChatGPT but customized for trash talk."

### If they ask "Can I get this?"
> "Yeah I can help you set it up. It's not hard, just needs an API key. I'll show you after the game."

### If they want to hire you
> "Funny you mention that - I actually do consulting on this stuff. Building personal AI assistants for people. We should talk." 

(Plant the seed, don't oversell)

## 🚫 What NOT to Show

- Don't show your personal dashboards (God Mode, Revenue, etc.)
- Don't talk about your goals/plans in detail
- Don't show Mission Control (too much info)
- Keep it fun and surface-level
- Save the deep stuff for people who are genuinely interested

---

## ✅ Success Looks Like

1. At least 5 people try Roast Bot
2. Someone says "this is crazy"
3. They ask for your number to learn more
4. Someone tags you in an Instagram story with the roast
5. You get at least 2 follow-up messages Monday

---

## 🎉 Have Fun!

The goal isn't to show off - it's to let them EXPERIENCE AI in a way that's fun and relevant to them.

Volleyball players + trash talk + AI = perfect combo.

Go crush it. 🏐🔥
