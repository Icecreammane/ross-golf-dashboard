## 📝 Post Body (Copy-Paste Ready)

```markdown
Hey r/golf!

I'm launching something I wish existed when I was grinding to break 90: **affordable, personalized video swing analysis with custom drills.**

**Here's what I'm offering:**
- 📹 Detailed video analysis of your swing (any angle works)
- 🎯 Custom drill recommendations for YOUR specific issues
- 📊 Weekly check-ins and progress tracking
- 💬 Unlimited questions via text/email
- 💰 **$29/month** (cancel anytime, no commitment)

**The catch:** I'm limiting this to my first **10 members** so I can give everyone proper attention. Those first 10 get **lifetime 50% off** ($14.50/month forever).

**How it works:**
1. Record your swing on your phone (down-the-line, face-on, whatever you can do)
2. Text or email it to me
3. Get detailed analysis + personalized drill plan within 24 hours
4. Practice, send follow-ups, improve

**Who am I?** Just a golfer obsessed with improvement. No PGA certification – I'm the guy who's spent hundreds of hours analyzing swings (mine and my buddies') and figured out what actually works. Think of this as a knowledgeable friend helping you out, not formal coaching.

**Landing page with details:** [YOUR_URL_HERE]

**Honest ask:** I'd genuinely love feedback from this community. What would make you trust a service like this? What am I missing? What sounds off? This is version 1.0 and I want to get it right.

Thanks for reading! 🏌️‍♂️

## 💬 Response Templates (10+ Scenarios)

### 1. "What are your credentials?"
```
Great question – I'm not a PGA pro or certified instructor. I'm just a golfer who's obsessed with improvement and has spent way too much time analyzing swings (mine and my friends'). 

Think of this as a knowledgeable friend helping you out for the cost of a couple range sessions per month, not formal coaching with certifications. That's exactly why I'm keeping it affordable and cancel-anytime – no risk to try it out.

If you need PGA-level instruction, this probably isn't for you. But if you want someone who's been through the grind and knows what works for real improvement, I'm your guy.
```

### 2. "Why not just watch YouTube videos?"
```
Totally valid! YouTube is great for general concepts. The difference here is personalization – I'm looking at YOUR swing, YOUR issues, and giving YOU specific drills.

It's the difference between "here's how to fix a slice" (generic) vs "your clubface is 8 degrees open at impact because of your grip, here are 3 drills specifically for that" (personalized).

But yeah, if YouTube is working for you, stick with it! This is more for people who've watched 50 videos and still aren't sure what applies to them.
```

### 3. "Why should I trust you?"
```
You shouldn't – yet! That's exactly why I'm doing lifetime 50% off for the first 10. I want to prove this works before asking anyone to pay full price. And it's cancel anytime with zero commitment.

If it doesn't help after the first month, no hard feelings. Cancel and you're out less than the cost of a round of golf.

I'm betting that if I deliver real value, you'll stick around. If I don't, you shouldn't.
```

### 4. "How is this different from [other app/service]?"
```
Good question! Most apps either:
- Give automated feedback (AI can't replace human eyes yet)
- Cost $100+ per month
- Don't include ongoing support

This is human analysis, affordable pricing, and I'm actually available for questions. You're not just getting a one-off video review – you get ongoing support as you work on the drills.

That said, if [other service] is working for you, awesome! Different things work for different people.
```

### 5. "What if I'm a total beginner?"
```
Even better! Beginners often build bad habits that are way easier to fix early than after years of practice. 

I'll keep the analysis simple and focused on 1-2 things at a time. No point overwhelming you with 10 things to fix – we'll prioritize what matters most and build from there.

If you can record a video and send it to me, you're qualified.
```

### 6. "What if I'm a single-digit handicap?"
```
Honestly? This might not be for you. At that level, you probably need someone with higher-level credentials and more technical knowledge.

This is best for mid-to-high handicappers (15+) trying to break through plateaus. If you're playing scratch golf, you're probably better off with a PGA pro.

But if you want to try it anyway, I won't stop you!
```

### 7. "How many swings can I send per month?"
```
Good question – I'm thinking 2-3 detailed analyses per month, plus unlimited quick check-ins. 

Like, if you're working on a drill and want to send a quick "am I doing this right?" video, that's totally fine. But full deep-dive analyses take time, so I want to keep those to 2-3 per month to maintain quality.

Does that sound reasonable? Open to feedback here!
```

### 8. "Can I get a free trial first?"
```
I hear you! Right now I'm doing the lifetime 50% off for first 10 instead of free trials – that way you're only committing $14.50 for the first month, and if it's not helpful, just cancel.

But you know what? If you're seriously on the fence, DM me. Maybe we can work out a single free analysis so you can see what you'd get. I just don't want to promise that to everyone publicly because I'll get slammed.
```

### 9. "This sounds too good to be true / is this a scam?"
```
Haha, I get it – internet skepticism is healthy! 

Here's the thing: I'm one person testing an idea. I'm not a company, there's no investor funding, I'm just trying to help people improve while making some side income.

The landing page is real, the offer is real, and if I screw people over, this community will (rightfully) destroy me. 

But I totally understand if you want to wait and see how the first few customers feel. Check back in a few weeks and I'm happy to share testimonials from early members.
```

### 10. "I'm interested! How do I sign up?"
```
Awesome! Head to [YOUR_URL_HERE] and fill out the form. You'll be in the first batch so you'll get extra attention as I dial this in.

Once you sign up, I'll email you within a few hours with next steps (how to send your swing video, what angles work best, etc.).

Looking forward to helping you improve! 🏌️
```

### 11. "What if I don't have video of my swing?"
```
No problem! Next time you're at the range or playing a round, just prop your phone up and hit record. 

Even if the angle isn't perfect or the quality is grainy, I can work with it. We're not making a Hollywood film – just need to see your swing clearly enough to analyze.

I'll send you tips on how to record it after you sign up, but honestly, just film yourself from any angle and we'll work with it.
```

### 12. "Why only 10 people?"
```
Two reasons:

1. **Quality over quantity** – I want to give everyone real attention, not just automated responses. If I take on 100 people at once, the quality tanks.

2. **Testing the idea** – This is version 1.0. I want to learn from the first 10, get feedback, and make sure I'm actually delivering value before scaling up.

If this works well, I'll open up more spots at the regular $29/month price. The first 10 are basically my beta testers, which is why they get the lifetime discount.
