### What Needs Work 🔴
- **CARBS:** Averaging 51% of target

  - Likely affecting recovery and energy
  
- **PROTEIN:** Averaging 75% of target
  - You got 600g, need 800g for 4 days
  - Missing ~200g for the week
  
- **OVERALL CALORIES:** Slightly undereating

### Top Issues to Fix Monday:
1. **Add carbs** - You're eating meat + fat but skipping starches
   - Add: rice, potatoes, pasta, oats with meals
2. **Track all meals** - Only 4 days logged, 3 missing
   - Log breakfast, lunch, dinner consistently
3. **Protein more consistent** - Varies 46-104% day to day
   - Aim for 200g every single day (easier than 173→208 swings)

## 🚀 Reset for Monday (Feb 9)

**Your target going forward:**
- 2,200 calories/day
- 200g protein/day (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight at 225 lbs)
- 250g carbs/day
- 70g fat/day

**Quick wins for next week:**
1. **Log everything** - All meals, snacks, drinks
2. **Add carbs** - 50-75g per meal (rice, potatoes, oats)
3. **Hit protein** - Aim for 45-50g per meal, 3-4 meals/day
4. **Consistent schedule** - Same meals, same times

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**You're close, but undereating on carbs.** Your body needs fuel for recovery, especially after leg and shoulder days. Add carbs back in, keep tracking, and next week you'll be dialed in.

**Current weight:** 225 lbs  
**Target:** 210 lbs  
**Approach:** Slight deficit + consistent macros = slow, steady progress

**You've got this. Let's crush it next week. 💪**
