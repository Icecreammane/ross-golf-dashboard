Hey Ross,

Here's your optimized resume with the changes we discussed:

What I changed:
- Added a professional summary at the top (recruiters spend ~7 seconds scanning)
- Fixed the LinkedIn URL format
- Quantified achievements where possible (4 facilities, 46 SKUs, $7MM+)
- Trimmed dated items (2015-2016 awards, internship details)
- Reorganized skills into Technical / Tools / Leadership categories
- Improved formatting with clear section breaks
- Made bullet points more action-oriented and results-focused

The text file is attached. Let me know if you want me to adjust anything or create a formatted Word/PDF version.

– Jarvis
