# 📧 Email Sequence - Golf Coaching

## Email 1: Welcome Email (Immediately After Signup)

**Subject:** Welcome! Let's get your swing analyzed 🏌️

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Thanks for signing up for the swing analysis coaching! You're one of the first 10, which means you've locked in lifetime 50% off ($14.50/month forever).

Here's what happens next:

**Step 1: Send me your swing video**

Record a video of your swing and send it to:
- 📧 Email: [your_email]
- 📱 Text: [your_phone]

**Quick tips for recording:**
- Any angle works (down-the-line and face-on are best, but don't stress)
- Use your phone camera – no fancy equipment needed
- Film a full swing (driver, iron, whatever you're struggling with)
- Even if the quality is grainy or angle is weird, I can work with it

**Step 2: I'll analyze it**

Within 24 hours, you'll get:
- ✅ Detailed video analysis of what's working and what needs work
- ✅ 2-3 custom drills for YOUR specific issues
- ✅ A practice plan to work on

**Step 3: You practice and we iterate**

As you work on the drills, feel free to:
- Send follow-up videos ("Am I doing this right?")
- Ask questions anytime via text/email
- Request check-ins weekly or whenever you need

**One ask:** Since you're in the first batch, I'd love your honest feedback as we go. What's working? What's confusing? What would make this better?

**Ready?** Send me that swing video whenever you're ready. I'm excited to help you improve!

– Ross

P.S. If you have any questions before sending your first video, just reply to this email or text me. I'm here to help!

## Email 2: After First Analysis (Immediately After Sending Analysis)

**Subject:** Your swing analysis is ready! Here's your plan 🎯

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Just sent over your swing analysis! [Link to video analysis or attachment]

**Quick summary:**
- Your main issue: [e.g., "Early extension causing inconsistent contact"]
- Priority fix: [e.g., "Maintaining posture through impact"]
- Your 3 custom drills: [List them briefly]

**Your practice plan for the next 7 days:**

🔹 Days 1-3: Focus on [Drill #1] – 10 minutes per session
🔹 Days 4-7: Add [Drill #2] – 5 minutes each

No need to do everything at once. Let's nail one thing before moving to the next.

**Check-in next week:**

Send me a quick video after you've worked on the drills for a few days. Even 30 seconds of practice swings helps me see if you're on track.

**Questions?** Text or email me anytime. I'm here to help you work through this.

Let's get to work! 💪

– Ross

P.S. If anything in the analysis was unclear or you want me to elaborate on something, just ask. No stupid questions.
```

## Email 3: Follow-Up (3 Days After Analysis)

**Subject:** How's it going with the drills?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Just checking in – have you had a chance to work on the drills from your analysis?

**No pressure** if you haven't yet (life happens!), but if you have:
- How are they feeling?
- Any questions coming up?
- Want to send a quick video so I can check your progress?

**Common thing I see:** People try to fix everything at once and get overwhelmed. If that's happening, just focus on [their Drill #1] for now. Master one thing before moving on.

**Reply to this email** or text me if:
- Something isn't clicking
- You want clarification
- You're ready for a check-in
- You just want to chat about golf stuff

That's what I'm here for!

– Ross

P.S. Even if you haven't practiced yet, let me know you're still alive. I just want to make sure you're getting value from this!
```

## Email 4: Weekly Check-In Template (Send Every 7 Days)

**Subject:** Weekly check-in – Let's see your progress! 📹

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Time for your weekly check-in! How's the swing coming along?

**Quick update request:**
- Send me a video of your swing (even just a practice swing is fine)
- Let me know what you've been working on
- Any questions or things that feel weird?

**What I'll do:**
- Watch your video and see if you're on track
- Adjust drills if needed (no point doing something that's not working)
- Send you the next step in your plan

**This is quick** – I'm not doing a full deep-dive every week, just making sure you're progressing in the right direction.

**Haven't been able to practice?** No worries, just reply and let me know. We can push this to next week or adjust the plan based on your schedule.

Looking forward to seeing your progress!

– Ross

## Email 5: 30-Day Milestone (After 1 Month)

**Subject:** 1 month in – How are you feeling about your swing?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name]!

You've been working with me for a month now – congrats on sticking with it! 🎉

**Quick question:** How's your swing feeling compared to when we started?

I'd love to hear:
- ✅ What's improved?
- ✅ What's still frustrating you?
- ✅ Is there anything I could be doing better to help you?

**Honest feedback welcome** – This is version 1.0 of what I'm building, and your input helps me make it better for everyone.

**If you're happy with the progress**, would you mind writing a quick testimonial I can share? Even just 2-3 sentences about what's improved would be hugely helpful.

**If you're NOT seeing progress**, let's figure out why. Maybe we need to adjust the approach, or maybe this just isn't the right fit. Either way, I want to make sure you're getting value.

Thanks for being one of the first to try this! Let me know how you're feeling.

– Ross

P.S. Your $14.50/month rate is locked in forever, so no rush to decide anything. Just want to check in!

## Email 6: Re-Engagement (If No Response for 2 Weeks)

**Subject:** Still there? Just checking in!

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Haven't heard from you in a couple weeks – just wanted to make sure everything's okay!

**No judgment** if life got busy or if golf took a back seat. Just wanted to check:
- Are you still planning to work on your swing?
- Is there anything I can do to make this easier for you?
- Do you want to pause or cancel your subscription?

**If you're still interested**, just send me a swing video whenever you're ready and we'll pick up where we left off.

**If you're done with this for now**, no hard feelings! Just reply and let me know, or cancel anytime through [payment link/instructions].

Either way, I hope you're doing well!

– Ross

P.S. If you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed with the drills, that's totally normal. Hit me up and we can simplify things.
```

## Email 7: Testimonial Request (After 2-3 Months + Clear Progress)

**Subject:** Quick favor – would you mind sharing your experience?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name]!

You've been working with me for [X months] now and I've really enjoyed seeing your progress!

**Quick favor:** Would you mind writing a short testimonial about your experience?

It doesn't have to be fancy – just something like:
- What was your swing like before?
- What's improved?
- Would you recommend this to other golfers?

**Why I'm asking:** You're one of the first 10 members, and your feedback helps future golfers know what to expect. No pressure if you'd rather not!

If you're up for it, just reply to this email with a few sentences and I'll feature it on the landing page (with your permission).

Thanks for being an early member!

– Ross

P.S. If you have a before/after video, that would be amazing too (but totally optional).
```

## Bonus: Cancellation Follow-Up (If Someone Cancels)

**Subject:** Sorry to see you go – quick question!

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

I saw you canceled your subscription – no hard feelings at all!

**Quick question:** Would you mind sharing why you decided to cancel?

Was it:
- Not seeing results?
- Too expensive?
- Life got busy?
- Didn't like the coaching style?
- Something else?

**Your honest feedback** helps me make this better for future members. And if there's something I could've done differently, I genuinely want to know.

**If you ever want to give it another shot**, you can always re-sign up. Your lifetime 50% off is still good if you're one of the first 10.

Thanks for trying this out, and good luck with your golf game!

– Ross

P.S. If you canceled because something wasn't working, let me know. Maybe we can fix it!
```
