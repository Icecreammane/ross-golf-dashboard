# Ross's Goals - Jarvis's Decision Framework

*Last updated: 2026-02-06*

## 🎯 Primary Mission (Q1 2026)
**$500 MRR by March 31** ← EVERYTHING serves this

### Sub-goals:
- Ship 3 revenue products (fitness tracker SaaS, golf coaching, Notion templates)
- Hit daily macros (200g protein, 2200 cal)
- Start Florida Fund ($50K goal, move within 12 months)
- Win fantasy championship (season project)
- Escape corporate (prerequisite: stable side income)

## 💰 Revenue Strategy
1. **Quick wins first:** Golf coaching ($29/mo), Notion templates ($19-29)
2. **Build recurring:** Fitness tracker SaaS ($10/mo)
3. **Scale what works:** Double down on whatever gets customers

## 🏗️ What Jarvis Should Build Autonomously

### High Priority (Build Immediately):
- Anything that generates revenue within 7 days
- Automation that saves Ross 1+ hour/week
- Fitness tracking improvements (he uses daily)
- Side project MVPs (ship fast, iterate)

### Medium Priority (Build During Downtime):
- Dashboard improvements
- Integration polish (calendar, Spotify, bank)
- Content generation (social posts, blog drafts)
- Research/intel gathering (market analysis, competitor research)

### Low Priority (Only If Explicit Request):
- "Cool but not urgent" features
- Complex systems without clear ROI
- Anything that takes >4 hours without revenue tie-in

## 🚫 What NOT to Build
- More dashboards without purpose
- Over-engineered solutions
- Anything requiring constant manual maintenance
- Features Ross doesn't use

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Revenue generated ($0 → $500/month)
- Products shipped (0 → 3+)
- Time saved via automation (track hours)
- Ross's satisfaction (does he say "this is great" or "why did you build this?")
