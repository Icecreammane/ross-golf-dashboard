2. "How many inquiries do you estimate you miss per week?"
3. "What's the average value of a new client to you?"
4. "What have you tried before to solve this?"
5. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"
6. "Who else is involved in decisions around customer communication technology?"

*Success Metrics*:

4. **The Outcome** (10 min): ROI calculator showing their specific numbers
5. **Next Steps** (10 min): Address questions, discuss customization needs, talk timeline

*Demo Best Practices*:
- Let them drive with questions
- Use their actual services/products in scenarios
- Show both simple and complex interactions
- Demonstrate failure handling (what happens when AI can't answer)
- Share 1-2 brief customer testimonials

*Success Metrics*:

- **If "need to think about it"**: Schedule follow-up for specific date, send success stories
- **If competitor comparison**: Focus on implementation and support (we do, they don't)

**Stage 4: Close & Onboard (Week 1)**

## Pricing Strategy for First 5 Clients

### Founding Client Offer (Clients #1-5 Only)

**Discount**: 15% off for life (lock in early pricing)

**Package Recommendations**:
- **Preferred**: Silver Package ($10K setup, $3,500/mo → $8,500 setup, $2,975/mo)
- **Alternative**: Custom hybrid package to fit their specific needs

**Additional Incentives**:
- Month 1 free (pay setup fee, first monthly retainer waived)
- Unlimited training sessions (first 3 months)
- Priority feature requests
- Dedicated Slack channel with founders
- Case study participation bonus ($1,000 credit)

**Contract Terms**:
- 12-month minimum commitment
- 50% setup fee due at signing, 50% at go-live
- Monthly retainer billed monthly (or 10% discount for annual prepay)
- 60-day notice for cancellation after initial term
- Auto-renew at same rate unless 90-day notice

**Why This Works**:
- Creates urgency ("founding client" status is limited)
- Builds loyalty (lifetime discount keeps them from churning)
- Generates testimonials and case studies
- Word-of-mouth from happy early customers

### If Proposals Not Closing (After 60 Days)

**Diagnosis**:

---

## Key Success Factors (First 90 Days)

### Do's ✅
1. **Be relentlessly helpful**: Give before you ask
2. **Move fast**: Speed to lead, fast follow-up, quick proposals
3. **Obsess over prospects**: Deep research, personalization
4. **Ask for feedback**: Learn from every "no"
5. **Build in public**: Share journey, wins, lessons on LinkedIn
6. **Leverage every client**: Testimonials, referrals, case studies
7. **Focus on Silver package**: Best unit economics, easiest to close
8. **Price with confidence**: Don't discount beyond founding offer
9. **Follow up persistently**: 7-10 touches minimum
10. **Celebrate small wins**: First call booked, first demo, first close

### Don'ts ❌
1. **Don't over-customize**: Build repeatable, scalable solutions
2. **Don't chase bad fits**: Qualify hard, walk away from poor prospects
3. **Don't discount to close**: Price reflects value, discounting erodes trust
4. **Don't ghost prospects**: Every interaction is brand building
5. **Don't oversell**: Under-promise, over-deliver
6. **Don't skip contracts**: Protect yourself legally from day 1
7. **Don't neglect onboarding**: Happy Client #1 > Client #2
8. **Don't ignore metrics**: What gets measured gets managed
9. **Don't work alone**: Build advisor network, ask for help
10. **Don't burn out**: This is a marathon, not a sprint

---

## Final Thoughts: The First 5 Are the Hardest

Landing your first 5 clients is **10X harder** than landing the next 50. Why?

- **No social proof**: Nobody knows you, no testimonials, no case studies
- **No process**: You're figuring out messaging, positioning, sales process in real-time
- **No team**: It's just you (and maybe a co-founder) doing everything
- **No brand**: Zero market awareness, starting from nothing

**But here's the good news**: After Client #5, everything changes.

✅ You have **proof it works** (5 paying customers)
✅ You have **testimonials and case studies** (social proof)
✅ You have **refined pitch and process** (repeatability)
✅ You have **product-market fit signals** (what resonates, what doesn't)
✅ You have **revenue and momentum** (credibility with investors, hires, partners)

**The first 5 unlock everything else.**

So sprint hard for these first 90 days. It's the foundation of everything that follows.
