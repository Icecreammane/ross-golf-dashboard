## Sales Positioning

### When They Say "I'll Think About It"
*"Let me ask: what's your time worth per hour? Most executives say $200-500. Our Executive Assistant package saves 10-15 hours/week. That's $2,000-7,500/week in value for $2,500/month. You're profitable from day one."*

### When They Say "That's Expensive"
*"Compared to what? A human EA costs $80k/year plus benefits, works 40 hours/week, takes vacations. Our AI works 168 hours/week, never sleeps, costs $30k/year. It's not expensive - it's 60% cheaper for 4x availability."*

### When They Say "I Can Use ChatGPT Myself"
*"Absolutely. The question is: do you want to spend your time prompt engineering and managing AI tools, or do you want us to handle that while you focus on what you do best? We're not selling AI access - we're selling your time back."*
