## Risk Analysis

### Key Risks

**1. Commoditization Risk**
- **Threat:** AI tools become so easy anyone can DIY
- **Mitigation:** Focus on service, not just technology. Human touch is differentiator.

- **Threat:** Google/Apple/Microsoft build native AI assistants
- **Mitigation:** Move fast, build brand, focus on premium segment they'll ignore

**3. Customer Acquisition Cost**
- **Threat:** Premium customers expensive to reach
- **Mitigation:** Personal brand content, referrals, strategic partnerships

**4. Service Delivery Quality**
- **Threat:** Can't maintain quality as we scale
- **Mitigation:** Invest in platform, processes, training. Grow deliberately.

**5. Privacy/Security Concerns**
- **Threat:** Handling sensitive personal data
- **Mitigation:** Best-in-class security, transparency, compliance. Make it a strength.
