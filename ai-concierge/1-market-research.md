## Market Gaps & Opportunities

### 🎯 **Primary Opportunity: Premium Personal Concierge**

**The Gap:**
- Low-end SaaS tools lack personalization
- Enterprise solutions are business-focused, not personal
- Human VAs can't scale or provide 24/7 availability
- No one is serving **affluent individuals** who want AI + human touch

**Our Position:**
- Premium personal AI concierge for executives, founders, high-net-worth individuals
- Custom setup ($5-10k) + monthly management
- Combines AI automation with white-glove human oversight
- Think "AI butler" not "chatbot"

### Secondary Opportunities

1. **Small Business "AI Employee" Package**
   - $2,500 setup + $500-1,500/month
   - Standardized but effective
   - Volume play

2. **Enterprise AI Consulting**
   - $50k+ strategic implementations
   - High margin, slower sales cycle
