# AI Concierge Target Customer Profiles

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-31 00:05 CST

## Executive Summary

Our ideal customers are **mid-market businesses (10-500 employees)** in high-value service industries who:
1. Receive significant inbound communication (calls, emails, chats)
2. Lose revenue from missed or poorly handled inquiries
3. Can't justify full custom AI development ($50K+) but need more than basic chatbots
4. Value customer experience as a competitive differentiator
5. Have budget authority to invest $5-10K setup + $2-5K/month

**Key Insight**: We're targeting the **"expensive minute"** businesses where every missed inquiry = lost revenue, but hiring 24/7 staff is cost-prohibitive.
