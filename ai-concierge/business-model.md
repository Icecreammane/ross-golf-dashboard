# AI Concierge Business Model

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-30 23:53 CST

## Executive Summary

Our AI concierge business targets the **"productized middle"** market gap: businesses willing to invest $5-10K in setup with ongoing monthly retainers, but who can't justify $50K+ custom consulting engagements. We combine pre-built AI components with industry-specific customization, white-glove implementation, and ongoing optimization services.

**Revenue Model**: Setup fees + monthly retainers + performance bonuses (hybrid model)

**Target**: Mid-market businesses (10-500 employees) in high-value verticals seeking enterprise-level AI capabilities at accessible price points.

## Break-Even Analysis

**Monthly Fixed Costs**: $43,000

**Break-Even Point** (assuming average Silver package client):
- Need ~$43,000 in gross margin per month
- At $1,900 gross margin per Silver client
- **Break-even: 23 Silver clients** (or equivalent mix)
- At 1 client/month pace: Break-even in month ~23
- At 2 clients/month pace: Break-even in month ~12
- At 3 clients/month pace: Break-even in month ~8

**Reality Check**: With setup fees providing cash buffer, actual cash-flow break-even happens much faster than MRR break-even.
