## Market Gaps We Can Fill

### 1. **The "Productized Middle"**
**Gap**: Most offerings are either dirt-cheap SaaS ($20-$99/mo) OR expensive custom consulting ($50K+). Few productized, mid-tier solutions exist for businesses wanting sophisticated AI concierge capabilities without full custom builds.

**Our Opportunity**: 
- Semi-custom AI concierge solutions
- $5-10K setup + $2-5K/month retainer
- Pre-built components with industry customization
- White-glove onboarding and training

### 2. **Industry-Specific Packaged Solutions**
**Gap**: Generic chatbots don't understand industry-specific workflows, compliance, or terminology. Most consultants charge premium rates to learn each client's industry from scratch.

**Our Opportunity**:
- Pre-built templates for high-value verticals (healthcare, financial services, professional services, real estate)
- Industry-specific training data and workflows
- Compliance and security built-in
- Charge premium over generic tools, discount vs. custom consulting

### 3. **Implementation + Optimization Services**
**Gap**: SaaS tools leave businesses struggling with setup and optimization. Consulting firms focus on strategy, not ongoing operational excellence.

**Our Opportunity**:
- White-glove setup and integration
- Ongoing optimization and fine-tuning
- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Training for internal teams
- Combine software + services

### 4. **Multi-Channel Integration**
**Gap**: Most AI concierges focus on one channel (phone, chat, email). Businesses want unified experiences across all touchpoints.

**Our Opportunity**:
- Voice + text + email unified AI assistant
- Cross-channel context and memory
- Integration with existing business systems (CRM, scheduling, payment)
- Single AI "personality" across all channels

### 5. **Performance-Based Pricing Models**
**Gap**: Most pricing is time-based or flat-fee. Few vendors offer performance guarantees or outcome-based pricing.

**Our Opportunity**:
- Hybrid models: Base fee + performance bonuses
- Guarantees on metrics (response time, lead capture rate, customer satisfaction)
- Risk-sharing that builds trust with new clients
- Differentiation in competitive market
