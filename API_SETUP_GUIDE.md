# API SETUP GUIDE - Gemini & Grok

**Goal:** Get both API keys configured so I can autonomously use them for research, trends, and workflow optimization.

---

## STEP 1: GEMINI API (Google)

### Get the API Key:

1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Select project (create new or use existing)
4. Copy the API key
5. **Give it to me:** Paste in next message

### What it's used for:
- Web search (research briefs, golf tech, fantasy trends)
- Fact-checking
- Deep research on topics

### Pricing:
- Free tier: 60 requests/min (plenty for our use)
- Paid: $0.075 per 1M tokens

---

## STEP 2: GROK API (xAI)

### Get the API Key:

**Option A (Recommended):**
1. Go to: https://console.x.ai/
2. Sign in with X/Twitter account
3. Create new API key
4. Copy it
5. **Give it to me:** Paste in next message

**Option B (If that doesn't work):**
1. Go to: https://grok.x.ai/
2. Look for "API Access" or "Developer"
3. Request API access
4. Wait for approval (usually 24-48h)
5. Get key when ready

### What it's used for:
- Monitor X for golf trends
- Monitor X for fantasy football trends
- Detect revenue opportunities
- Spot emerging AI tools/techniques

### Pricing:
- Check xAI pricing page (usually $0.05 per 1K tokens or similar)
- Start with free tier if available

## ONCE YOU GET THE KEYS:

Just paste them here (or in a private message). I'll:

1. Store them securely in Clawdbot config
2. Wire them into my workflow
3. Start using them immediately:
   - **Gemini:** Tomorrow's research briefs will use real data
   - **Grok:** Daily X trends scans start automatically
   - **Codex:** Already working for overnight builds

---

## SECURITY NOTE:

- ✅ API keys will be stored in your Clawdbot config (encrypted)
- ✅ Never shared externally
- ✅ Only used by me for approved tasks
- ⚠️ If you ever need to revoke: Just tell me, I'll remove them

---

## TIMELINE:

- **Today:** You get keys + paste them
- **Tonight:** I reconfigure with new APIs
- **Tomorrow 8am:** Research brief uses real Gemini data
- **Tomorrow 9am:** First Grok trend scan runs
- **Tomorrow+:** All automations use these for better output
