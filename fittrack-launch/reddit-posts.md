After 7 years of lifting, I've tried every macro tracker out there. MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Lose It, MacroFactor - you name it, I've logged meals in it.

They all had the same problem: **they're built for everyone, so they're optimized for no one.**

MyFitnessPal removed the barcode scanner from free and now wants $80/year. Cronometer tracks 84 nutrients when I care about 3. Every app is either bloated with features I'll never use, or paywalling stuff that used to be free.

I don't need recipes, fitness challenges, social feeds, or gamification. I just need to know: *Did I hit my protein target today?*

So I built **FitTrack** - a macro tracker that gets out of your way.

**The core philosophy:** MyFitnessPal has 47 features. You use 3. FitTrack has 3 features. You'll use 3.

**What it does:**
- Log food in seconds (search is actually fast)
- See your daily macros at a glance
- Track weight alongside nutrition
- Clean, minimal interface (no ads, no clutter)
- Your data stays yours (export anytime)

**What it doesn't do:**
- Nag you with notifications
- Sell your data to advertisers
- Force you into "challenges"
- Recommend keto meal plans you'll never make

It's $10/month after a 7-day free trial. No upsells, no premium tiers, just one simple product that does one thing well.

I built this for myself, but figured others might want it too. If you're tired of bloated trackers that feel like homework, give it a shot.
