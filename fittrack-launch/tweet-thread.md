**Tweet 1: Hook (The Problem)**

After 7 years of lifting, I've tried every macro tracker.

They all suck for the same reason:

They try to be everything, so they're optimized for nothing.

Here's what I built instead 🧵

**Tweet 2: My Story**

I'm not a fitness influencer or a nutrition coach.

I'm just a guy who's been tracking macros since 2019.

MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Lose It, MacroFactor - I've tried them all.

And I always came back to the same frustration...

---

**Tweet 3: What I Tried (Competitor Reality Check)**

MyFitnessPal: Removed barcode scanner from free, now $80/year. Cluttered with ads. Slow as hell.

Cronometer: Tracks 84 nutrients. I care about 3. Built for nutritionists, not lifters.

Lose It: MFP clone with different UI. Same bloat.

MacroFactor: Better, but over-engineered for my needs.

None of them just... work.

**Tweet 4: The Problem with Every Tracker**

MyFitnessPal has 47 features.

You use 3.

I don't need:
❌ Recipe suggestions
❌ Social feeds
❌ Fitness challenges
❌ Meal plans
❌ Gamification

I need:
✅ Fast food search
✅ Daily macro totals
✅ Clean interface

That's literally it.

**Tweet 5: What I Built**

So I built FitTrack - the anti-MyFitnessPal.

Philosophy: MFP has 47 features. You use 3. FitTrack has 3 features. You'll use 3.

• Log food in seconds (not minutes)
• See macros at a glance (no buried menus)
• Track weight + nutrition (that's it)
• No ads, no clutter, no BS

Built for lifters who know their shit.

---

**Tweet 6: Features (The Essentials)**

What FitTrack does:
• Fast, accurate food database
• Clean dashboard (macros + weight)
• Export your data anytime
• Privacy-focused (no data selling)

What it doesn't do:
• Everything else

It's intentionally minimal.

---

**Tweet 7: Pricing**

$10/month after a 7-day free trial.

No upsells, no premium tiers, no hidden fees.

One simple product that does one thing well.

(Because I'm tired of apps that nickel-and-dime you for basic features)

---

Here's why I made it 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
After 7 years of lifting, I've tried every tracker.

MFP = ads + bloat
Cronometer = too technical
Lose It = MFP clone

They all try to be everything. I just need fast macro tracking.

---

**Tweet 3:**
FitTrack does 3 things:
1. Log food (fast search, no clutter)
2. Show daily macros (clean dashboard)
3. Track weight (see progress)

That's it. No recipes, no social feeds, no gamification.

---

**Tweet 4:**
It's $10/month because that's how I keep it ad-free and privacy-focused.
