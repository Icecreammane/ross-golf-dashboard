# FitTrack Pre-Launch Marketing Kit

**Goal:** Build audience THIS WEEK before Friday launch (Feb 13)

**Problem:** Ross has zero audience. Can't launch to empty room.

**Solution:** Start marketing NOW. Build anticipation. Launch to warm crowd.

**Timeline:** Feb 7-13 (7 days to build buzz)

---

## Why This Matters

**Launching without audience:**
- ❌ Post on r/fitness → gets buried → 5 signups → dies
- ❌ Tweet to 0 followers → crickets
- ❌ Zero momentum, zero social proof

**Launching WITH audience:**
- ✅ Post on r/fitness → 50+ people already excited → upvotes → visibility
- ✅ Tweet to warm followers → instant engagement → retweets
- ✅ Momentum from day 1 → social proof → more signups

**Goal for Feb 13:** 50-100 people know about FitTrack BEFORE you post launch.

---

### Pre-Written Tweets

**Copy-paste these, or adapt to your voice.**

### **Friday, Feb 7 (Day 1) - Problem Introduction**

**Tweet 1 (Post NOW):**
```
After 7 years of lifting, I've learned one thing: tracking macros doesn't have to suck.

MyFitnessPal is great but way too complicated for most lifters.

We just need: calories, protein, carbs, fat.

So I built something simpler.

Launching next Friday. 🚀
```

**Tweet 2 (Evening, ~8pm):**
```
Real question:

When you track macros, do you actually care about:
- Vitamin B12?
- Omega-6 fatty acids?
- Calcium levels?

Or do you just want to know if you hit your protein target?

Most trackers give you too much. I'm building one that gives you exactly enough.
```

---

### **Saturday, Feb 8 (Day 2) - Problem/Solution Contrast**

**Tweet 1 (Morning, ~10am):**
```
The problem with most macro trackers:

❌ Too many features
❌ Cluttered UI
❌ Slow to log
❌ Annoying barcode scanning
❌ Ads everywhere

What lifters actually need:

✅ Fast food logging
✅ Simple macro view
✅ Progress charts
✅ Nothing else

Launching Friday.
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon, ~3pm):**
```
I don't need my macro tracker to:
- Suggest recipes
- Count my steps
- Track my water intake
- Show me ads for protein powder

I need it to:
- Tell me my macros
- Let me log food fast
- Show me progress

That's it. That's the app I'm launching Friday.
```

---

### **Sunday, Feb 9 (Day 3) - Personal Story / Authenticity**

**Tweet 1 (Morning, ~11am):**
```
Real talk: I don't have a six-pack.

Been lifting 7 years. Built muscle, got stronger, feel great.

But I'm not Instagram shredded. And that's okay.

FitTrack isn't for physique competitors. It's for normal lifters who just want to hit their macros and improve.

Launching Friday. 💪
```

**Tweet 2 (Evening, ~7pm):**
```
Why I'm building FitTrack:

I tried:
• MyFitnessPal (too complex)
• Cronometer (too data-heavy)
• LoseIt (ads everywhere)
• Excel (works but manual)

Nothing felt *simple* enough.

So I built what I wish existed.

4 more days.
```

---

### **Monday, Feb 10 (Day 4) - Build in Public / Transparency**

**Tweet 1 (Morning, ~9am):**
```
Progress update on FitTrack:

✅ Food logging works
✅ Macro calculations accurate
✅ Progress charts look clean
✅ Stripe integration done
⚠️ Still fixing a bug in workout tracking
⏳ Deploying to production Wednesday

3 days until launch. Getting real now. 🚀
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon, ~2pm):**
```
Honest moment:

I've never launched a paid product before.

FitTrack is $10/month. I have no idea if anyone will pay.

But I've spent 40+ hours building it because I genuinely wanted this to exist.

Launching Friday at 7pm. We'll see what happens. 🤷‍♂️
```

---

### **Tuesday, Feb 11 (Day 5) - Screenshots / Proof**

**Tweet 1 (Morning, ~10am):**
```
Preview: FitTrack in 3 screenshots

[Screenshot 1: Dashboard - clean macro view]

**The form:**
- Captures emails before launch
- Stores in text file
- Shows confirmation message
- Looks professional

### Backend API Endpoint

**File saved at: `fittrack-launch/backend-early-access.py`**

**Add to Flask app (`app_saas.py` or similar):**

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime
from flask import jsonify, request

@app.route('/api/early-access', methods=['POST'])
def early_access_signup():
    """
    Capture early-access email signups
    Stores in data/early-access-emails.txt
    """
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        email = data.get('email', '').strip().lower()
        
        # Basic validation
        if not email or '@' not in email:
            return jsonify({"success": False, "error": "Invalid email"}), 400
        
        # Ensure data directory exists
        os.makedirs('data', exist_ok=True)
        
        # Check if email already exists
        email_file = 'data/early-access-emails.txt'
        if os.path.exists(email_file):
            with open(email_file, 'r') as f:
                existing_emails = [line.split(',')[0] for line in f.readlines()]
                if email in existing_emails:
                    return jsonify({"success": True, "message": "Already subscribed"}), 200
        
        # Save email with timestamp
        with open(email_file, 'a') as f:
            timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
            f.write(f"{email},{timestamp}\n")
        
        # Optional: Send to email service (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.)
        # add_to_mailchimp(email)
        
        return jsonify({
            "success": True, 
            "message": "You're on the list! Launch day is Feb 13 at 7pm."
        }), 200
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in early_access_signup: {e}")
        return jsonify({"success": False, "error": "Server error"}), 500


@app.route('/api/early-access/count', methods=['GET'])
def early_access_count():
    """
    Get count of early-access signups (for admin)
    """
    try:
        email_file = 'data/early-access-emails.txt'
        if os.path.exists(email_file):
            with open(email_file, 'r') as f:
                count = len(f.readlines())
            return jsonify({"count": count}), 200
        return jsonify({"count": 0}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500
```

**After deployment, test:**
```bash
# Test signup
curl -X POST https://[your-url]/api/early-access \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com"}'

```
Hey! Quick favor — I built a macro tracking app and need honest feedback before I launch Friday.

It's basically MyFitnessPal but way simpler. Just calories/protein/carbs/fat, no BS.

Can you try it and tell me what sucks? Takes 2 min.

[link when deployed]

Appreciate you 🙏
```

---

### Version 2: Gym Buddies

**Use for:** People you lift with, gym acquaintances

```
Yo! Remember how we were complaining about MyFitnessPal being annoying?

I built something simpler. Launching Friday but want you to try it first.

[link]

Let me know if it's actually better or if I'm delusional 😂
```

---

### Version 3: Fitness Influencer Friends

**Use for:** Anyone with a following, fitness accounts, coaches

```
Hey [name]! Been following your content, love what you're building.

I made a simple macro tracker for lifters. Launching Friday.

Would love your feedback if you have 5 min? And if it's actually good, maybe you'd share it with your audience?

[link]

Either way, thanks for what you do! 💪
```

---

### Follow-Up Strategy

**If they try it:**
```
Dude, thank you for testing! 🙏

Quick Q: What's one thing I should fix before I launch Friday?
```

**If they like it:**
```
🙏🙏🙏

Can I screenshot your feedback and use it as a testimonial?

Would mean a lot.
```

**If they don't respond:**
- Don't be pushy
- Send 1 reminder Wed evening: "Still launching Friday if you wanna check it out 👀"
- Move on

---

## Part E: Reddit Launch Post (Friday 7:05pm)

### r/Fitness Post Template

**Title:**
```
I built a simpler macro tracker (for lifters who find MyFitnessPal too complicated)
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/fitness,

After 7 years of lifting, I got tired of how complicated MyFitnessPal is.

Don't get me wrong—MFP is great. But it's got way too many features I never use. I just want to track: calories, protein, carbs, fat. That's it.

So I built **FitTrack** — a simpler macro tracker.

**What it does:**
- Fast food logging (no barcode scanning BS)
- Clean macro dashboard
- Progress charts over time
- That's it. No recipes, no meal plans, no ads.

**Why I built it:**
- MFP is cluttered
- Cronometer is data overload
- LoseIt has too many ads
- Excel works but manual

I wanted something *just* for macros.

**Try it:** [LINK]

7-day free trial. $10/month after.

Built by a lifter (me), for lifters (you).

**Not trying to replace MFP for everyone.** If you love MFP, keep using it. This is for people like me who want less.

Would love your feedback. Tell me what sucks. 💪

—Ross

## Why This Works

**Most indie hackers:**

3. Give up

**You (if you follow this):**
1. Build in public (last week of dev)
2. Build anticipation (daily tweets)
3. Launch to warm audience (50-100 people ready)
4. Get momentum (signups, comments, engagement)
5. Iterate and grow

**Difference:** You're marketing BEFORE launch, not after.
