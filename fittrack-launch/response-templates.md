# FitTrack Response Templates

## Quick Copy-Paste Responses for Common Questions/Objections

---

### 1. "What makes this different from MyFitnessPal?"

**Response:**
"MFP has 47 features. You use 3. FitTrack has 3 features. You'll use 3.

Specifically: MFP tries to be everything - recipes, social network, fitness challenges. They also removed the barcode scanner from free and now charge $80/year for features that used to be included. FitTrack does one thing: track macros fast. No ads, no clutter, no bait-and-switch pricing. Built for lifters who know their shit."

---

### 1b. "Why not MyFitnessPal?" (NEW - Competitor-Specific)

**Response:**
"Three reasons:

1. **Feature bloat** - MFP has social feeds, recipe blogs, meal plans, challenges. I just need to log food and see my macros.

2. **Paywall creep** - They removed the barcode scanner from free in 2024 and now charge $80/year for features that used to be free. That's a bait-and-switch.

3. **Speed** - MFP takes 2+ minutes to log a meal because of all the clutter. FitTrack takes 30 seconds.

If you're an experienced lifter who knows your macros and just wants fast tracking, FitTrack is built for you. If you're a beginner who needs hand-holding and recipes, MFP might still be better."

---

### 2. "Why should I pay $10 when MFP is free?"

**Response:**
"Fair question! MFP is free because they sell your data and show ads. FitTrack costs $10 because that's how I keep it ad-free and privacy-focused. If you value your time (faster search, no bloat) and your data, it's worth it. Try the free trial and see if you agree."

---

### 3. "Can I see screenshots?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely! Check the landing page [link] - there's a full gallery. TLDR: clean dashboard, fast food search, simple macro breakdown. No clutter, no confusion."

---

### 4. "Does it have [feature X]?"

**Response:**
"Not yet! Right now it's intentionally minimal: food logging, macro tracking, weight tracking. If there's something specific you need, let me know - I'm building based on what actual users want, not what I think they want."

---

### 5. "Why would I trust a new app?"

**Response:**
"Totally fair. I'm one guy building this, not a big company. Your data is stored securely, you can export it anytime, and I'm not selling it to anyone. I built this for myself first - if you check my post history, I've been lifting and tracking for years. This is a real tool, not a cash grab."

---

### 6. "Is my data safe?"

**Response:**
"Yes. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, hosted on secure servers. I don't sell your data, period. You can export everything anytime you want. Privacy policy is on the site if you want the full details."

---

### 7. "What if I cancel?"

**Response:**
"Cancel anytime, no questions asked. You keep access until the end of your billing period, then your account goes read-only (you can still export your data). No hard feelings!"

---

### 8. "How do you calculate macros?"

**Response:**
"Food data comes from USDA and crowdsourced databases (similar to MFP). You can also create custom foods. Macros are calculated from the foods you log - I don't auto-generate targets for you (though I might add a calculator later if people want it)."

---

### 9. "This sounds like an ad"

**Response:**
"I get it - I'm launching a product on Reddit, so of course I'm promoting it. But I'm also a lifter who genuinely built this for myself. Check my post history if you want proof I'm a real person, not a marketing team. Just trying to share something I think others will find useful."

---

### 10. "Do you have an app (mobile)?"

**Response:**
"Not a native app yet, but the web version is mobile-responsive and works great on phones. You can add it to your home screen and it behaves like an app. Native iOS/Android apps are on the roadmap if there's demand."

---

### 11. "I'm interested! How do I sign up?"

**Response:**
"Hell yeah! Head to [link] and start your 7-day free trial. No credit card required upfront. Let me know if you hit any issues or have feedback - I'm actively building based on user input."

---

### 12. "Can I get a discount?"

**Response:**
"The 7-day free trial is the best I can do right now - it's already priced pretty low at $10/month. That said, if you're a student or genuinely can't afford it, DM me and we'll figure something out."

---

### 13. "Will you add [feature]?"

**Response:**
"Maybe! I'm keeping it intentionally simple right now, but I'm building based on what users actually ask for. What's the use case? If enough people need it, I'll prioritize it."

---

### 14. "I tried it, here's a bug..."

**Response:**
"Thanks for the heads up! Can you DM me details (what happened, what browser/device you're on)? I'll get it fixed ASAP. Appreciate you trying it out!"

---

### 15. "Just signed up! Love it so far!"

**Response:**
"That's awesome, thanks for giving it a shot! Let me know if you have any feedback or feature requests as you use it. Really appreciate the support!"

---

## Bonus: Handling Trolls

### "This is garbage / I could build this in a weekend"

**Response:**
"Cool! If you build something better, let me know - I'm always looking for good tools. Until then, this works for me and hopefully others."

*(Don't engage further - trolls aren't your customer)*
