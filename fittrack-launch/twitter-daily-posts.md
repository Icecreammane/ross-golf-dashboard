# FitTrack Twitter Daily Posts (Feb 7-13)

**Purpose:** Pre-written tweets for each day leading up to launch

**How to use:** Copy-paste (or adapt) one morning tweet + one evening tweet each day

**Goal:** Build audience and anticipation before Friday launch

---

## Friday, Feb 7 (Day 1) - Problem Introduction

### Morning Tweet (~10am)

```
After 7 years of lifting, I've learned one thing: tracking macros doesn't have to suck.

MyFitnessPal is great but way too complicated for most lifters.

We just need: calories, protein, carbs, fat.

So I built something simpler.

Launching next Friday. 🚀
```

### Evening Tweet (~8pm)

```
Real question:

When you track macros, do you actually care about:
- Vitamin B12?
- Omega-6 fatty acids?
- Calcium levels?

Or do you just want to know if you hit your protein target?

Most trackers give you too much. I'm building one that gives you exactly enough.
```

## Saturday, Feb 8 (Day 2) - Problem/Solution Contrast

### Morning Tweet (~10am)

```
The problem with most macro trackers:

❌ Too many features
❌ Cluttered UI
❌ Slow to log
❌ Annoying barcode scanning
❌ Ads everywhere

What lifters actually need:

✅ Fast food logging
✅ Simple macro view
✅ Progress charts
✅ Nothing else

Launching Friday.
```

### Afternoon Tweet (~3pm)

```
I don't need my macro tracker to:
- Suggest recipes
- Count my steps
- Track my water intake
- Show me ads for protein powder

I need it to:
- Tell me my macros
- Let me log food fast
- Show me progress

That's it. That's the app I'm launching Friday.
```

## Sunday, Feb 9 (Day 3) - Personal Story / Authenticity

### Morning Tweet (~11am)

```
Real talk: I don't have a six-pack.

Been lifting 7 years. Built muscle, got stronger, feel great.

But I'm not Instagram shredded. And that's okay.

FitTrack isn't for physique competitors. It's for normal lifters who just want to hit their macros and improve.

Launching Friday. 💪
```

### Evening Tweet (~7pm)

```
Why I'm building FitTrack:

I tried:
• MyFitnessPal (too complex)
• Cronometer (too data-heavy)
• LoseIt (ads everywhere)
• Excel (works but manual)

Nothing felt *simple* enough.

So I built what I wish existed.

4 more days.
```

## Monday, Feb 10 (Day 4) - Build in Public / Transparency

### Morning Tweet (~9am)

```
Progress update on FitTrack:

✅ Food logging works
✅ Macro calculations accurate
✅ Progress charts look clean
✅ Stripe integration done
⚠️ Still fixing a bug in workout tracking
⏳ Deploying to production Wednesday

3 days until launch. Getting real now. 🚀
```

### Afternoon Tweet (~2pm)

```
Honest moment:

I've never launched a paid product before.

FitTrack is $10/month. I have no idea if anyone will pay.

But I've spent 40+ hours building it because I genuinely wanted this to exist.

Launching Friday at 7pm. We'll see what happens. 🤷‍♂️

## Advanced: Engagement Strategy

**Between tweets, every day:**

1. **Reply to 5-10 fitness posts**
   - Search: "macro tracking", "MyFitnessPal", "bulking", "cutting"
   - Add value, don't spam
   - Build presence in fitness Twitter

2. **Follow back engaged users**
   - Anyone who likes/replies to your tweets
   - Follow fitness accounts
   - Goal: 50+ followers by Friday

3. **Retweet relevant content**
   - Fitness tips
   - Other indie hackers
   - Show you're part of the community

4. **DM interested people**
   - If someone seems very interested, DM them
   - "Hey! Saw you were interested in FitTrack. Want early access? Here's the link: [link]"

## Content Principles

**Do:**
- ✅ Be honest and transparent
- ✅ Share personal story
- ✅ Highlight problem you're solving
- ✅ Build anticipation
- ✅ Engage with every comment

**Don't:**
- ❌ Overhype or promise too much
- ❌ Trash-talk competitors
- ❌ Ignore criticism
- ❌ Post without engaging
- ❌ Give up if first tweets flop

**Remember:** Most indie products get 5-10 signups on day 1. If you follow this plan, you'll get 20-50. That's a huge win.

**Copy these tweets. Post daily. Build your audience. Launch to a warm crowd. 🚀**
