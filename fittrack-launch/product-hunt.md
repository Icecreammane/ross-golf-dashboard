## First Comment (Maker Intro)

**Post this immediately after launching:**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Ross, and I built FitTrack because I was tired of macro trackers that feel like homework.

**The backstory:**

I've been lifting for 7 years. In that time, I've tried every macro tracker - MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Lose It, MacroFactor. They all have the same problem: feature creep.

I don't need recipes, meal plans, social feeds, or "challenges." I just need to know: *Did I hit my protein today?*

So I built FitTrack - a macro tracker that does one thing well: help you track your nutrition without getting in your way.

**What makes it different:**

- **Fast:** Food search actually works (no lag, no clutter) - log meals in 30 seconds, not 2+ minutes like MFP
- **Clean:** Minimal UI, no ads, no distractions - MFP has 47 features, FitTrack has 3
- **Privacy-focused:** Your data isn't sold to advertisers (unlike "free" apps that monetize your data)
- **Simple pricing:** $10/month, no upsells or premium tiers - no bait-and-switch like MFP removing barcode scanner from free
- **Honest positioning:** Built for lifters who know their macros, not beginners who need hand-holding

**What it's NOT:**

- Not a meal planner
- Not a recipe app
- Not a social network
- Not a fitness tracker (just nutrition)

It's intentionally minimal. If you're tired of apps that try to do everything, this might be for you.

I'm here all day to answer questions, take feedback, and hear what you think. Thanks for checking it out!

## FAQ Prep (for comments)

**Q: How is this different from MFP?**
A: Three key differences:

1. **Speed** - MFP is bloated with 47 features (social, recipes, challenges). FitTrack has 3 features (log, track, progress). Logging a meal takes 30 seconds, not 2+ minutes.

2. **Pricing honesty** - MFP removed the barcode scanner from free and now charges $80/year for features that used to be included. FitTrack is $10/month, all features included, no surprises.

3. **Target user** - MFP tries to serve everyone (beginners, casual dieters, athletes). FitTrack is built specifically for experienced lifters who know their macros and just want fast tracking.

**Comparison:**
- **MyFitnessPal:** 47 features, you use 3
- **FitTrack:** 3 features, you'll use 3

If you're past the beginner phase and tracking feels like homework, FitTrack is for you.

**Q: Why $10/month?**
A: That's how I keep it ad-free and privacy-focused. MFP is "free" because they monetize your data. FitTrack doesn't.

**Q: Mobile app?**
A: Not yet - web version is mobile-responsive. Native apps coming if there's demand.

**Q: What's on the roadmap?**
A: Building based on user feedback. Right now it's intentionally minimal. If people want specific features, I'll prioritize them.

**Q: Can I try it?**
A: Yes! 7-day free trial, no credit card required. [link]

## Tips for Product Hunt Success

1. **Launch on Tuesday-Thursday** (most traffic)
2. **Reply fast** (first 6 hours are critical)
3. **Be genuine** (PH community hates fake/salesy)
4. **Ask for feedback** (not just votes)
5. **Engage with other launches** (support others, they'll support you)
6. **Don't vote-brigade** (PH will penalize you)
7. **Have a backup plan** (if you don't hit #1, you can re-launch in 6 months with improvements)

**Success metrics:**
- Top 10 of the day = great
- Top 5 = excellent
- #1 = unicorn (don't expect it first try)

Even if you don't rank high, PH brings quality traffic and feedback. Win either way.
