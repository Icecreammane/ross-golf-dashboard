# Friend Outreach Scripts

**Goal:** Get 10 friends to test FitTrack before Friday launch

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Real feedback from actual users
- ✅ Find bugs before public launch
- ✅ Get testimonials for social proof
- ✅ Early customers = launch day momentum
- ✅ Word-of-mouth marketing

**When to send:** Feb 10-12 (after deployment, before launch)

---

## Who to Ask

**Best candidates:**

1. **Gym friends** - People you lift with
2. **Fitness people** - Anyone who tracks macros currently
3. **Honest friends** - People who'll tell you what sucks
4. **Tech-savvy friends** - People who can give product feedback
5. **Supportive friends** - People who want to see you succeed

**Make a list of 15 people** (aim to get 10 responses)

---

## Version 1: Close Friends

**Use for:** Best friends who'll be brutally honest

**Tone:** Casual, real, asking for genuine help

```
Hey! Quick favor — I built a macro tracking app and need honest feedback before I launch Friday.

It's basically MyFitnessPal but way simpler. Just calories/protein/carbs/fat, no BS.

Can you try it and tell me what sucks? Takes 2 min.

[link]

Appreciate you 🙏
```

**Why this works:**
- Direct ask
- Low time commitment ("2 min")
- Emphasizes honesty ("tell me what sucks")
- Personal favor

---

## Version 2: Gym Buddies

**Use for:** People you work out with, gym acquaintances

**Tone:** Relatable, shared pain point

```
Yo! Remember how we were complaining about MyFitnessPal being annoying?

I built something simpler. Launching Friday but want you to try it first.

[link]

Let me know if it's actually better or if I'm delusional 😂
```

**Why this works:**
- References shared experience
- Self-deprecating humor
- Implies exclusivity ("try it first")

---

## Version 3: Fitness Influencer Friends

**Use for:** Anyone with a following, fitness accounts, coaches

**Tone:** Professional but personal, value exchange

```
Hey [name]! Been following your content, love what you're building.

I made a simple macro tracker for lifters. Launching Friday.

Would love your feedback if you have 5 min? And if it's actually good, maybe you'd share it with your audience?

[link]

Either way, thanks for what you do! 💪
```

**Why this works:**
- Compliments their work (genuine)
- Clear value exchange (feedback for potential share)
- No pressure ("if it's actually good")
- Respectful of their time

---

## Version 4: Tech Friends (Non-Lifters)

**Use for:** Developer friends, product people, entrepreneurs

**Tone:** Product feedback focused

```
Hey! Launching a SaaS Friday and need product feedback.

It's a macro tracker for lifters (simpler than MyFitnessPal).

Can you check it out from a UX/product perspective? Looking for what feels clunky.

[link]

Would really value your eye on this 🙏
```

**Why this works:**
- Frames as product feedback (not fitness)
- Plays to their expertise
- Specific ask ("what feels clunky")

---

## Version 5: Supportive Friends

**Use for:** Friends who always support your projects

**Tone:** Excited, appreciative

```
Dude! I finally finished the fitness app I've been working on.

Launching Friday but want you to see it first.

[link]

Would love to know what you think! 🚀
```

**Why this works:**
- Shares excitement
- Makes them feel included ("see it first")
- Simple, no pressure

---
