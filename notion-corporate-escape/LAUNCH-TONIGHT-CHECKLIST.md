## QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING

**"I'm nervous about posting"**
→ Everyone is. Post anyway. Worst case: no one cares. Best case: you make $500. Risk/reward is clear.

**"What if no one buys?"**
→ Then you learn what doesn't work and try again. But you won't know until you ship.

**"The template isn't perfect"**
→ It doesn't need to be. Ship it, get feedback, improve it. Version 1.0 > Version 0 (stuck in your head).

**"What if people criticize it?"**
→ Some will. That's fine. Not everyone will get it. Focus on the people it helps.

**"I don't have a big audience"**
→ Neither do most successful indie makers. You're selling to people with a problem, not followers.

---

## ENERGY CHECK

**Before you start:**
- [ ] You're not exhausted (if you are, rest first—you'll work faster)
- [ ] You've eaten (low blood sugar = bad decisions)
- [ ] Phone on Do Not Disturb (no distractions)
- [ ] Coffee/water nearby

**This is 90 minutes of work that could change your trajectory.**

You're not just launching a template. You're proving to yourself that you can build, ship, and monetize.

That's the skill that gets you to Florida.

## FINAL REMINDER

**Done > Perfect**
