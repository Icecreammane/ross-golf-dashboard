### Risk Assessment

#### What Could Go Wrong?

**Risk 1: Projects don't generate revenue fast enough**
- *Mitigation:* Launch multiple small bets, validate quickly, pivot fast. Focus on proven markets.

**Risk 2: Burnout from side hustle + full-time job**
- *Mitigation:* Fitness routine (non-negotiable), energy management, strategic rest days.

**Risk 3: Florida costs more than expected**
- *Mitigation:* Over-save (aim for 12-month runway), research thoroughly, scout in advance.

**Risk 4: Imposter syndrome / self-doubt**
- *Mitigation:* Daily journaling, community support, track small wins, remember why I started.

**Risk 5: Job market changes (harder to go back)**
- *Mitigation:* Build valuable skills (AI, automation, product), maintain network, keep LinkedIn active.

**Risk 6: Health issues / emergency**
- *Mitigation:* Emergency fund separate from move fund, health insurance plan, stay fit.

## 🔋 ENERGY MANAGEMENT

### The Truth About the Grind

You're running two jobs: corporate (8-10 hrs) + side hustle (2-4 hrs) + life (fitness, relationships, sanity). **Burnout will kill the dream faster than anything else.**

---

### Burnout Prevention Strategies

**Weekly Energy Audit:**
| Day | Energy Level (1-10) | What Drained Me | What Energized Me |
|-----|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Mon | | | |
| Tue | | | |
| Wed | | | |
| Thu | | | |
| Fri | | | |
| Sat | | | |
| Sun | | | |

**Average Energy:** [Calculate] → If below 6, take action!

---

### Recovery Activities (The "Refuel" List)

When energy drops below 5/10, pick one:

- [ ] **Full rest day** (no side project work)
- [ ] **Nature walk** (30+ min, no phone)
- [ ] **Social time** (friends who energize you)
- [ ] **Creative play** (hobby with zero pressure)
- [ ] **Extra sleep** (9+ hours, guilt-free)
- [ ] **Long workout** (endorphins > productivity)
- [ ] **Say no** (cancel something, create space)

**Rule:** One recovery activity per week minimum. Two if grinding hard.

---

### Work-Life Balance During Transition

**The "Hell Yes or No" Filter:**
- Corporate job? Yes (for now, it's funding freedom)
- Side projects? Hell yes (building the future)
- Social obligation that drains you? **NO.**
- Relationship that matters? Hell yes
- Mindless scrolling? **NO.**
- Fitness? Hell yes (non-negotiable)

**Protect your energy like your life depends on it. Because your escape does.**

---

### Dopamine Defense Tactics

**The Problem:** Corporate job = boring. Brain craves dopamine hits (social media, junk food, Netflix binges). These kill progress.

**The Solution: Intentional Dopamine**

**High-Value Dopamine (Do More):**
- ✅ Shipping a feature
- ✅ First customer
- ✅ Workout PR
- ✅ Savings milestone hit
- ✅ Skill breakthrough

**Low-Value Dopamine (Do Less):**
- ❌ Infinite scroll (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok)
- ❌ Junk food binges
- ❌ Binge-watching TV
- ❌ Online shopping
- ❌ Arguing on the internet

**Tactics:**
1. **Delete social apps** from phone (browser only, intentional use)
2. **Block distracting sites** during work hours (Freedom, Cold Turkey)
3. **Reward system:** Hit goal → guilt-free fun
4. **Replace bad habits:** Craving scroll? Do 10 pushups instead

---

## 🧠 MENTAL GAME

### Mindset Shifts Needed

**From → To:**
- Corporate job = identity → Corporate job = **temporary funding source**
- Security = steady paycheck → Security = **skills + savings + options**
- Success = promotion → Success = **freedom + impact + fulfillment**
- Risk = scary → Risk = **calculated, managed, necessary**
- Failure = permanent → Failure = **data, lesson, redirect**

---

### Dealing with Imposter Syndrome

**The Voice:** "Who are you to build products? You're just a [job title]. You're not a real entrepreneur."

**The Truth:**
- ✅ Every entrepreneur started as "not a real entrepreneur"
- ✅ You're learning by doing (the only way that works)
- ✅ Your background is an advantage (you understand corporate customers)
- ✅ Done is better than perfect
- ✅ You don't need permission to build

**When It Hits:**
1. **List your wins** (no matter how small)
2. **Remember why** (read your motivation section)
3. **Ship anyway** (action kills doubt)

---

### Handling Uncertainty

**What You Can't Control:**
- Market response to your products
- Economic conditions
- Other people's opinions
- Timing of success

**What You CAN Control:**
- **Showing up daily** (consistency > intensity)
- **Shipping projects** (velocity > perfection)
- **Learning from failures** (pivot fast)
- **Managing energy** (fitness, rest, focus)
- **Building skills** (invest in yourself)
- **Saving money** (every dollar = freedom closer)

**Focus on the controllables. Let the rest go.**

---

### Staying Motivated When Progress Is Slow

**The Reality:** Most overnight successes take years. Progress is not linear.

**Motivation Strategies:**

1. **Track micro-wins:** 
   - Coded today? Win.
   - Shipped a feature? Win.
   - Saved $100? Win.
   - Worked out? Win.

2. **Visualize the future:**
   - What does your first day in Florida feel like?
   - What time do you wake up when you control your schedule?
   - Who are you when you're free?

3. **Compare to past-you, not others:**
   - Where were you 3 months ago?
   - What have you built since then?
   - How much closer are you to $500 MRR?

4. **Join the struggle:**
   - Find others escaping corporate
   - Share the journey
   - Accountability > motivation

5. **Remember the alternative:**
   - 5 more years of the same corporate grind
   - Never taking the shot
   - Regret > failure

**You're not behind. You're in the arena. Keep going.**
