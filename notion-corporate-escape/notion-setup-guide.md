# Notion Setup Guide - Corporate Escape Plan Template

## Welcome!

You've got the template. Now let's get it into your Notion workspace and customized for *your* escape journey.

**Time to complete:** 15-20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy (if you can click buttons, you can do this)

---

## STEP 1: Duplicate the Template to Your Workspace

### If You Have a Notion Account:

1. **Open the template link** (provided in your Gumroad purchase)
2. **Click "Duplicate"** in the top-right corner
3. **Select your workspace** (Personal or team workspace)
4. **Click "Duplicate"** again

✅ **Done!** The template is now in your Notion workspace.

---

### If You DON'T Have a Notion Account:

1. **Go to notion.so**
2. **Sign up** (free account is fine)
3. **Verify your email**
4. **Open the template link** (from your Gumroad purchase)
5. **Click "Duplicate"** and select your new workspace

✅ **Done!** You're ready to customize.

---

## STEP 2: Customize the Dashboard (10 minutes)

### Update Your Progress Metrics

**Open the Dashboard page** and fill in your current reality:

| Metric | What to Enter |
|--------|---------------|
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue** | Your current MRR (probably $0—that's fine!) |
| **Florida Fund Balance** | How much you've saved toward your move fund (or $0) |
| **Days Until Freedom** | Calculate: [Target escape date] - [Today] |
| **Side Projects Launched** | How many projects you've shipped (0 is fine) |
| **Skills Acquired** | How many new skills you've learned (be honest) |

**Pro tip:** Start with zeros. Watching these numbers grow is *highly* motivating.

---

### Set Your Current Focus

Under **"🎯 Current Focus (This Week)"**:

- **Primary Goal:** What's the ONE thing you need to accomplish this week?
  - Example: "Validate fitness tracker idea with 5 potential users"
- **Secondary Goal:** What's the supporting goal?
  - Example: "Save $500 toward Florida fund"
- **Key Blocker:** What's in your way?
  - Example: "Don't know how to build landing pages"

---

### List Your Quick Wins

Under **"🔥 Quick Wins This Week"**, list 3 small, achievable wins:

1. "Set up morning routine (wake up at 6am for 5 days)"
2. "Research Florida neighborhoods (spend 2 hours)"
3. "Ship one feature on side project"

**Why this matters:** Quick wins build momentum. Big goals can feel overwhelming. Small wins keep you moving.

---

### Fill in Motivation Station

Under **"💪 Motivation Station"**, write:

**Why I'm doing this:**
- "I want to wake up without an alarm."
- "I want to work from a beach."
- "I'm tired of asking permission to take a day off."

**What freedom looks like:**
- "Living in Florida, working 4-6 hours/day, building products I care about, staying fit, feeling alive."

**When I want to quit, remember:**
- "I'd rather try and fail than spend 30 years wondering 'what if.'"

**Bookmark this page.** You'll need it on hard days.

---

## STEP 3: Fill in "The Plan" Section (15 minutes)

This is where you get real with yourself.

### Vision: What Does Freedom Look Like?

**Location:**
- Replace "Florida" with your target location (or keep Florida if that's your goal!)
- Be specific: "Sarasota, FL - beach town, low cost of living, year-round warm weather"

**Work:**
- What will you do? "Build SaaS products, consult 10 hrs/week, create content"
- What does your ideal workday look like? "Wake at 7am, workout, deep work 9am-1pm, beach afternoon, light work evening if inspired"

**Income:**
- How much do you need? "$4K/month to feel safe, $6K/month to feel comfortable"

**Time:**
- What will you do with freedom? "Surf, read, build, spend time with people I actually like"

**Health:**
- "Stay fit year-round. Train 5x/week. Prioritize energy over everything."

---

### Timeline: The Roadmap to Freedom

**Set your Target Escape Date:**
- Be realistic but ambitious
- Example: "October 1, 2025" (gives you 9 months to build)

**Customize the milestones:**
- Edit the quarterly goals to match YOUR timeline
- Example: If you're targeting a 6-month escape, condense Q3/Q4

**Make it visible:**
- Add to your phone calendar
- Set a countdown timer
- Tell someone (accountability)

---

### The Numbers: Reality Check

**Fill in your Monthly Expenses (Current):**
- Go through your bank statements
- Be brutally honest
- Include EVERYTHING (subscriptions you forgot about, coffee runs, etc.)

**Fill in Monthly Expenses (Florida Target):**
- Research cost of living in your target location
- Zillow for rent estimates
- Numbeo.com for general cost comparisons

**Calculate Income Needed:**
- Minimum to survive: [Your number]
- Comfortable living: [Your number + 20%]
- Savings + buffer: [Comfortable + $500]
- TARGET MRR: [This is your goal]

**The Runway Calculation:**
- Savings goal ÷ Monthly expenses = Months of runway
- Example: $50,000 ÷ $4,000 = 12.5 months
- Adjust savings goal if needed (more runway = less risk)

---

### Risk Assessment

**Customize the risks to YOUR situation:**

The template includes 6 common risks. Add your own:
- "Risk 7: Partner/spouse not on board"
- "Risk 8: Visa issues (if moving internationally)"
- "Risk 9: [Your specific fear]"

**For each risk, write:**
- What's the worst-case scenario?
- How likely is it (1-10)?
- What's your mitigation plan?

**This isn't pessimism. It's preparation.**

---

## STEP 4: Set Up Income Streams (10 minutes)

### Add Your Side Projects

**Project 1: [Your Idea]**
- Name it (even if it's just "Idea #1")
- Set status: 💡 Idea / 🔨 Building / 🚀 Launched / 💸 Revenue
- Describe it in one sentence
- Set a Goal MRR (even if it's just $100)

**If you don't have ideas yet:**
- Brainstorm 3 quick ideas (even bad ones)
- Use the "Idea Backlog" section
- Focus on problems YOU have (best starting point)

**Example ideas:**
- Notion template (hey, that's what you just bought!)
- Chrome extension
- Simple SaaS tool
- Consulting/freelancing in your current skill
- Content/course on something you know

---

### Set Revenue Goals by Quarter

**Adjust the table to match YOUR timeline:**

| Quarter | MRR Goal | Projects | Strategy |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Q1 2025 | $500 | 1 launched | Ship fast, validate |
| Q2 2025 | $1,500 | 2 active | Scale winner |
| Q3 2025 | $3,000 | 2-3 active | Double down |
| Q4 2025 | $4,000+ | 1-2 core | Sustainable |

**Start small.** $500 MRR is achievable in 90 days if you ship fast and validate demand.

---

## STEP 5: Set Up Florida Fund Tracker (5 minutes)

### Replace "Florida" with Your Target Location

**Search & replace:**
- Press `Cmd+F` (Mac) or `Ctrl+F` (Windows)
- Search for "Florida"
- Replace with your location (e.g., "Bali", "Austin", "Remote Anywhere")

### Update the Savings Goal

**Default is $50K. Adjust based on:**
- Your target location cost of living
- Your risk tolerance (more runway = less stress)
- Your current income (realistic savings rate)

**Example adjustments:**
- **Lower cost location (Thailand, Portugal):** $25K-$30K
- **Higher cost location (San Francisco, NYC):** $75K-$100K
- **Remote from home:** $15K-$20K (lower move costs)

### Fill in Current Balance

**Update the table:**
- Savings account: [Your actual number]
- Side project revenue: [Current MRR × 12]
- Other: [Any additional funds]

**Set up a reminder** to update this monthly (or weekly if you're grinding hard).

---

## STEP 6: Customize Daily Systems (10 minutes)

### Design Your Morning Routine

**Default routine:**
- Wake up: 6:00 AM
- Workout: 45-60 min
- Breakfast: High-protein
- Review goals: 10 min
- Deep work: 1-2 hrs on side project

**Customize to YOUR life:**
- Adjust times (if you're not a morning person, shift to evening deep work)
- Adjust workout (gym, home, running, yoga—whatever you'll actually do)
- Keep the structure: Fitness → Fuel → Focus

**The key:** Win before your corporate job starts. Build the escape before work drains you.

---

### Set Your Evening Routine

**Default routine:**
- Dinner: 6:00 PM
- Side project work: 2-3 hrs
- Learn/Read: 30 min
- Evening reflection: 10 min
- Wind down: 9:30 PM
- Bed: 10:00 PM (7-8 hrs sleep)

**Adjust:**
- If you're fried after work, shift deep work to mornings
- If you have family commitments, work in 30-min blocks
- If you're a night owl, embrace it (just protect sleep)

**Non-negotiable:** Sleep 7-8 hours. You can't escape if you're exhausted.

---

## STEP 7: Customize Skill Development (5 minutes)

### Replace Example Skills with YOURS

**Template defaults:**
1. AI/Automation
2. Product Development
3. Marketing/Sales
4. Fitness/Health
5. Content Creation

**Your skills might be:**
1. Web development (if you're building apps)
2. Copywriting (if you're selling products)
3. SEO (if you're doing content)
4. Graphic design (if you're creating)
5. Video editing (if you're on YouTube)

**For each skill:**
- Current level (1-10, be honest)
- Target level (8-10 for core skills, 6-7 for supporting)
- Learning resources (courses, books, people to follow)
- Practice projects (how you'll apply it)

---

## STEP 8: Adapt Location-Specific Sections

### Move Cost Breakdown

**Update these numbers for YOUR location:**

**Pre-Move Costs:**
- Apartment hunting trip: [Your estimate]
- Application fees: [Research local market]
- First month rent: [Zillow/Rightmove/local site]
- Security deposit: [Usually 1-2 months rent]
- Moving truck/shipping: [Based on distance]

**First-Month Costs:**
- Furniture: [Will you buy new or bring existing?]
- Utilities setup: [Deposits, connection fees]
- Groceries/supplies: [First big shop]
- License/registration: [Local DMV fees]

**Buffer:** Always include a buffer (10-20% of total costs).

---

## STEP 9: Set Up Tracking Systems (5 minutes)

### Enable Notion Reminders

**For these recurring tasks:**
- **Weekly review:** Sunday 6pm (set Notion reminder)
- **Monthly fund update:** 1st of each month (set reminder)
- **Quarterly goal review:** Last Sunday of each quarter (set reminder)

**How to set reminders in Notion:**
1. Type `/remind` in any page
2. Set date/time
3. Notion will ping you

---

### Create Linked Databases (Optional, Advanced)

**If you want to track across pages:**
- Create a master "Projects" database
- Link it to Income Streams, Launch Log, Skill Development
- Filter/sort by status, revenue, priority

**How:**
1. Create new database (`/database`)
2. Add properties (Name, Status, Revenue, Priority)
3. Link to it from other pages (`/linked database`)

**Skip this if you're just starting.** Use the template as-is first.

---

## STEP 10: Personalize & Make It Yours (Ongoing)

This template is a starting point. Here's how to make it YOURS:

### Add Your Personality
- **Change cover images:** Click "Add cover" at the top of each page
- **Add emojis:** Click the emoji icon (or type `:emoji_name:`)
- **Adjust colors:** Highlight text, change background colors
- **Add photos:** Drag images into pages (your target beach, workout progress, etc.)

### Add New Sections
- **If you're freelancing:** Add "Client Pipeline" section
- **If you're building audience:** Add "Content Calendar"
- **If you're learning to code:** Add "100 Days of Code" tracker
- **If you're into stocks/crypto:** Add "Investment Tracker"

**The template grows with you.**

---

### Remove What You Don't Need

**Not relevant to you?** Delete it.
- Don't care about fitness tracking? Remove it.
- Not building products? Remove Launch Log, focus on Freelance Income.
- Already have a location? Skip the location research sections.

**Keep it lean.** Only track what moves you forward.

## TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### 1. Update It Regularly
**Daily:** Quick wins, fitness log, energy level  
**Weekly:** Review progress, plan next week  
**Monthly:** Update fund tracker, reflect, adjust goals  
**Quarterly:** Big review, pivot if needed

**If you don't update it, it's just a pretty dashboard. Make it a living document.**

---

### 2. Don't Obsess Over Perfection
- Rough notes > no notes
- 80% complete > 100% perfect
- Done > perfect

**The goal is progress, not perfection.**

---

### 3. Use It Every Day
**Make it your homepage:**
- Open Notion → Set this template as your default page
- Start every day by reviewing Dashboard
- End every day with Evening Reflection

**The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes.**

---

### 4. Share Your Journey (Optional)
- Tweet your progress (builds accountability)
- Post in communities (find allies)
- Share wins with friends (celebrate)

**You don't have to go silent until you "make it." The journey IS the story.**

---

### 5. Adapt Ruthlessly
**Every month, ask:**
- What's working? (Do more of it)
- What's not? (Cut it or fix it)
- What's missing? (Add it)

**This is YOUR escape plan. Make it fit YOUR life.**

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't know where to start."
→ **Start with Dashboard.** Fill in your current reality (even if it's all zeros). Then set one goal for this week.

### "I don't have any project ideas."
→ **Start with problems YOU have.** What annoys you daily? What do you wish existed? That's your first idea.

### "This feels overwhelming."
→ **You don't have to fill everything out today.** Pick ONE section, fill it out, move forward. Progress > perfection.

### "I'm not good at tracking/systems."
→ **That's okay. This template makes it easy.** Just open it daily and fill in one thing. Build the habit slowly.

### "What if my escape plan changes?"
→ **Good. It should.** The template adapts. You'll learn what works, pivot, adjust. That's the process.
