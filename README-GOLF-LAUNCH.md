## 🎯 What Makes This Landing Page Effective

### Design Decisions:
- **Dark golf theme** → Professional, memorable
- **Large fonts** → Readable on mobile (where r/golf users are)
- **Multiple CTAs** → "Reserve Your Spot" appears 3 times
- **Urgency elements** → "First 10 members only" creates FOMO
- **Benefit-focused** → Shows clear value (video analysis, drills, support)
- **Low-friction form** → Only 3 fields (email, name, handicap)
- **Trust signals** → Cancel anytime, unlimited questions, fast turnaround

### Pricing Strategy:
- **$14.50/month early bird** → Impulse-buy territory
- **"Lifetime" discount** → Makes it feel exclusive
- **Scarcity (10 spots)** → Creates urgency
- **Clear comparison** → Shows $29 crossed out
- **Cancel anytime** → Removes risk

### Mobile-First:
- 70%+ of r/golf traffic is mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons
- No tiny text
- Fast loading (no images)
- Smooth scroll between sections
