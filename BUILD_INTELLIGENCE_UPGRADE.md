## 🎮 How to Use

### For Ross (Main Agent):

**Just talk normally.** The systems work automatically:
- Memory search happens before every response
- Predictions prepare context proactively
- Tone adjusts based on time/context
- Actions are scored for confidence
- Templates speed up builds
- Night research runs while you sleep

### Manual Commands (if needed):

```bash
# Test all systems
python3 ~/clawd/scripts/test_intelligence_systems.py

# Check memory recall
python3 ~/clawd/scripts/instant_recall.py

# View behavior patterns
cat ~/clawd/memory/behavior_patterns.json

# Read latest intel report
cat ~/clawd/reports/daily_intel_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# Check decision model
cat ~/clawd/memory/decision_model.json

# View personality evolution
cat ~/clawd/memory/personality_model.json
```
