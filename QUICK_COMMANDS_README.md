# 🚀 Quick Commands System

**Built:** 2026-02-02 8:34pm

## How It Works

Instead of typing full details, use shortcuts!

## 🍽️ Food Shortcuts

**Just say:**
- "usual lunch" → Logs chicken + brussels + mashed potatoes (500 cal)
- "beef bowl" → Logs ground beef hash brown bowl (1,040 cal)
- "banana" → Logs medium banana (105 cal)
- "beef sticks" → Logs 3 beef sticks (135 cal)
- "kombucha" → Logs GT's kombucha (60 cal)

**I recognize these and auto-log with correct macros!**

## 🏋️ Workout Templates

**Just say:**
- "leg day" → I'll ask which weights you used, pre-fill template
- "chest day" → Template with your typical chest exercises
- "back day" → Template with deadlifts, rows, pull-ups

## 📊 Quick Status

**Just say:**
- "status" → Today's macros summary
- "wins" → Today's wins logged
- "progress" → This week's progress
- "dashboard" → Link to fitness dashboard

## How I Detect Commands

When you message:
1. I check if your text matches a shortcut
2. If yes → auto-log or template
3. If no → normal conversation

**Examples:**

❌ **Before:**
You: "I had grilled chicken with brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes for lunch, probably 500 calories, 42g protein, 40g carbs, 18g fat"
Me: *logs it*

✅ **Now:**
You: "usual lunch"
Me: ✅ Logged! Chicken + Brussels + Mashed Potatoes (500 cal, 42g protein)
