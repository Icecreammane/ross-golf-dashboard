## 📋 RESPONSE TEMPLATES (Quick Reference)

### Q: "What are your credentials?"
**A:** "Not a PGA pro – just a knowledgeable friend helping out for cheap. That's why it's affordable and cancel-anytime."

### Q: "Why not YouTube?"
**A:** "YouTube = generic. This = personalized to YOUR swing, YOUR issues, YOUR drills."

### Q: "Why should I trust you?"
**A:** "You shouldn't yet! That's why first 10 get 50% off for life and it's cancel anytime. Prove value first."

### Q: "I'm interested!"
**A:** "Awesome! Head to [URL] and reserve your spot. Looking forward to helping you improve!"
