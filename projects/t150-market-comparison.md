## Category: Players Distance Irons

The T150 sits in the "players distance" category - forged feel with added ball speed and forgiveness. Not a blade, not game improvement. The sweet spot for accomplished golfers who want performance without sacrificing workability.

### Key T150 Specs:
- Forged construction (pure feel)
- Muscle Channel technology (3-7 irons for added speed)
- 1° stronger lofts vs T100
- Slightly larger head than T100 for stability
- Player's profile (not chunky)

---

## Direct Competitors (Same Category)

### 1. **TaylorMade P790 (2025)**
**Price:** ~$1,600-1,800 (stock shafts)
**Pros:**
- Most popular in category (98% recommendation rate)
- Proven distance performance
- Hollow body construction similar to T150
- Great availability/fitters

**Cons:**
- Less refined feel than T150 (foam-filled vs forged muscle channel)
- "Clicky" feel compared to pure forged
- Mass market vs boutique

**Verdict:** More club for the money off-rack, but custom T150 will outperform stock P790s.

---

### 2. **Ping i230**
**Price:** ~$1,500-1,700 (stock shafts)
**Pros:**
- Direct T150 equivalent per Reddit consensus
- Clean looks, proven forgiveness
- PowerSpec option for custom specs
- Ping fitting network is excellent

**Cons:**
- Less "sexy" brand perception
- Slightly less distance than P790/T150

**Verdict:** Equal performance tier, but you already have custom T150s coming.

---

### 3. **Srixon ZXi5**
**Price:** ~$1,400-1,600 (stock shafts)
**Pros:**
- **BEST FEEL in category** (rivals Mizuno)
- Consistently beats P790 in blind feel tests
- Underrated brand = better value
- Tour-level performance

**Cons:**
- Less name recognition
- Fewer fitters carry full Srixon lineup

**Verdict:** If you were buying off-rack, this would be my #1 pick for feel/value. But custom T150 > stock Srixon.

---

### 4. **Mizuno JPX 925 Forged**
**Price:** ~$1,500-1,700 (stock shafts)
**Pros:**
- **LEGENDARY FEEL** (Mizuno's reputation earned)

- Pure forged construction
- Golfer's club

**Cons:**
- ~13 yards SHORTER than competitors in testing
- 63% larger shot dispersion than blades
- Less "tech" appeal

**Verdict:** If feel > distance matters most, this is the choice. But you got fitted for T150 for a reason.

---

### 5. **Callaway Apex Ai200**
**Price:** ~$1,600-1,800 (stock shafts)
**Pros:**
- AI-optimized faces (tech appeal)
- Similar performance envelope to T150
- Strong brand/resale value

**Cons:**
- Less proven than P790/T150
- "AI" marketing vs true fitting advantage

**Verdict:** Interesting option, but not better than your custom setup.

## Titleist Family Comparison

### **T100** (What most players "graduate from")

- Player's profile with modern performance
**For:** Golfers who want to score without fighting their clubs

### **T200**

## Shaft Analysis: Oban CT-115 Steel X

### What Makes It Special:
- **115-gram mid-weight** (heavier than stock ~105g shafts)
- **Low spin profile** (penetrating ball flight)
- **Smooth feel with stability** (not harsh like Project X)
- **Tight dispersion** (better accuracy)
- **Premium construction** (Oban/Shimada quality)

### Stock Shaft Alternatives (What You'd Get Off-Rack):
1. **KBS Tour** (~$40/shaft upcharge)
   - Industry standard
   - Similar weight/profile
   - Good, not great

2. **Project X** (~$40/shaft upcharge)
   - Stiffer, more aggressive
   - Tour-proven
   - Less smooth feel than Oban

3. **True Temper Dynamic Gold** (~$30/shaft upcharge)
   - Classic tour shaft
   - Heavier (120g+)
   - Traditional feel

4. **Nippon Modus³ 120** (~$50/shaft upcharge)
   - Japanese precision
   - Similar weight to Oban
   - Great option

### Expert Consensus on Oban CT-115:
- "Best feel, stability, ball flight, and ball dispersion"
- "Like KBS Tour meets Project X"
- "Smooth loading with tight grouping"
- "My dispersion shrunk to a size I've never experienced"
- Tour-level shaft at premium price

**Your Advantage:** Most off-rack clubs don't offer Oban. You got fitted specifically for this shaft for YOUR swing.

---

## Off-Rack vs Custom: The Math

### **Stock P790s (Closest Off-Rack Competitor)**
- Price: ~$1,800
- Shafts: Stock steel (KBS Tour or Dynamic Gold)
- Grips: Stock
- **Total: ~$1,800**

### **Your Custom T150 Build**
- Base irons: ~$2,000
- Oban CT-115 shafts: ~$900 upcharge ($100/shaft × 9 clubs)
- Custom grips: ~$80
- Wedges: ~$550
- Putter: ~$400
- Full bag fitting: ~$100
- **Total: $4,714.87**

### **Premium Over Stock:**
- $2,914.87 more than stock P790s
- BUT: Custom-fit to YOUR swing with premium components
- Stock clubs are "good enough for most"
- Custom clubs are "optimized for YOU"

---

## Resale Value Considerations

### **Best Resale:**
1. Titleist (holds value best)
2. TaylorMade P790 (popular = liquid market)
3. Mizuno (cult following)
4. Ping (solid but slower market)
5. Srixon (undervalued = harder resale)

### **Your T150 Setup:**
- Titleist = premium resale
- Oban shafts = boutique appeal
- Custom specs = niche buyer (slower sale)
- Bettinardi putter = excellent resale

**Estimated resale after 1 year:** ~$2,800-3,200 (60-68% of purchase)
**Estimated resale after 3 years:** ~$1,800-2,200 (38-47% of purchase)

---

## The Bottom Line: What You Should Use

### **Short Answer: Keep the T150 order. Here's why:**

1. **You Already Got Custom Fit**
   - Chancellor Wiginton is a Master Fitter - he tested YOU, not marketing specs
   - Data-driven fitting > internet opinions
   - Your swing dictated these specs

2. **Oban CT-115 Shafts Are Elite**
   - Not available off-rack
   - Fitted specifically for your swing speed/tempo
   - Premium upgrade you'll feel on every shot

3. **T150 Is Peak Performance Without Compromise**
   - Not too demanding (like T100)
   - Not too forgiving (like T200)
   - Goldilocks zone for scoring

4. **Switching Now = Starting Over**
   - Different clubs = different fitting needed
   - Oban shafts alone are $900 value
   - You'd lose deposit/restocking fees

5. **P790s/Srixon/i230 Are Great... But Not Better**
   - Stock clubs for $1,800 < Custom clubs for $4,700
   - If you wanted off-rack, you'd have gone to Golf Galaxy
   - You invested in custom for a reason

---

## What About Your Old Clubs?

**Recommendation: Keep them for 60 days, then sell.**

Why:
- Use them as baseline comparison when new clubs arrive
- Validate the fitting (you should see measurable improvement)
- Emergency backup during break-in period
- Then sell while they still have value

**Where to Sell:**
- Callaway Pre-Owned (if Callaway)
- 2nd Swing Golf
- SidelineSwap
- Facebook Marketplace (Golf groups)
- OfferUp/Craigslist

---

## Future Considerations

### **If You Ever Want to Switch (1-2 years from now):**

**Best Alternative Based on Priorities:**

1. **If you want MAXIMUM FEEL:**
   → Mizuno JPX 925 Forged or Pro 245
   → Accept ~10 yards less distance for butter feel

2. **If you want MAXIMUM FORGIVENESS:**
   → Titleist T200 or T250
   → Still Titleist family, easier to hit

3. **If you want BEST VALUE:**
   → Srixon ZXi5 (custom fit)
   → 90% of T150 performance, 60% of cost

4. **If you want MOST POPULAR:**
   → TaylorMade P790
   → Can't go wrong, proven winner

**But honestly?** Play the T150s for 2-3 years minimum. They're endgame clubs.

## Action Items

- ✅ Research saved to projects/t150-market-comparison.md
- ⏳ Wait for clubs to arrive (est. 2-3 weeks)
- 📊 Establish baseline with old clubs (TrackMan/range session)
- 🎯 First round with new clubs = data collection
- 📈 Track performance improvement
- 💰 Sell old clubs after 60 days

---

## My Recommendation as Your AI Co-Pilot

**KEEP THE T150 ORDER.**

You didn't spend $4,700 on impulse. You got custom fit by a master fitter who tested YOUR swing with data. The T150 + Oban CT-115 combo is elite-level gear that will:

1. **Improve your ball striking** (more forgiving than blades)
2. **Add distance** (muscle channel tech + stronger lofts)
3. **Tighten dispersion** (Oban shafts = accuracy)
4. **Look badass** (player's profile, not chunky)
5. **Hold value** (Titleist resale is top-tier)

The internet will always have "better deals" - but you can't fit yourself. Trust the process. Trust the fitter. Trust the data.

**Play these clubs for 2-3 years. Track your scores. Then decide.**

If you're still curious about P790s or Srixons in 6 months, we can arrange a demo day. But I'd bet money you'll love the T150s once you hit them.
