## IS YOUR CLUB CHAMPION DEAL COMPETITIVE?

### The Verdict: **GOOD, BUT ROOM TO NEGOTIATE**

#### What You're Getting
✅ **Titleist T150** — Tour-level irons, excellent reputation

✅ **Vokey SM11 wedges** — Tour-proven quality  
✅ **Premium custom fitting** — Full launch monitor analysis  
✅ **Financing** — $392/month spreads cost  

#### The Challenge
❌ **Premium pricing** — T150 retail ~$2,500-3,500, not $3,500  
❌ **Fitting markup** — $350 fitting rolled into total ($280-300 more than competitors)  
❌ **Cheaper alternatives exist** — Callaway Paradym ($700-800) or Cobra Darkspeed ($799)  
❌ **Better value elsewhere?** — Get T150s at Fairway Jockey + fitting at PGA Superstore = ~$2,200-2,500 total
