## 💡 THE HONEST TRUTH

**Getting to $500 MRR will take 6-12 months.**

Not today. Not this week. But it's achievable.

**Today is about:**
- Laying the foundation
- Proving you can ship
- Building momentum
- Getting your first product live

**Don't expect:**
- Overnight success
- Viral launch
- $100+ this week

**Do expect:**
- Slow start (normal!)
- Learning curve
- Need for iteration
- Long-term compound growth

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.** 🏃‍♂️
