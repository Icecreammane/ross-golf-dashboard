## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING & ADJUSTMENTS

### **If Putter Feels Off (Rounds 1-3)**

### **If T150 Irons Feel Different (Rounds 1-5)**
✅ **Normal:** New shafts/heads change ball flight slightly  
✅ **Action:** Log distances to establish baseline  
✅ **Expect:** +1-2 yards vs. old irons, better consistency

### **If Scores Don't Drop Immediately**
✅ **Normal:** Equipment change takes 10-15 rounds  
✅ **Action:** Track progress, don't abandon new clubs  
✅ **Remember:** Tour pros see equipment benefits over 5+ rounds

### **If You Struggle with New Specs**
✅ **Action:** Return to Club Champion for re-fitting
