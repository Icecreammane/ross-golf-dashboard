# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated knowledge and insights about Ross and our work together.*

---

## Who Ross Is
- **Age:** 30 | **Location:** Nolensville, TN
- **Career:** Product developer, pet food industry
- **Status:** Single
- Dreams of escaping corporate life for Florida — beach volleyball, golf, freedom

## The Big Goals
1. **Financial Freedom** — build income outside the 9-5
2. **Peak Fitness** — structured weightlifting, real results
3. **Fantasy Football Glory** — championship or bust
4. **The Florida Dream** — the ultimate destination

## Working Style
- Wants a co-pilot who pushes him, not just answers questions
- Action-oriented — prefers plans over theory
- Competitive streak (fantasy sports, fitness PRs)
- **Values continuity:** Expects me to remember conversations to prevent redundancy
- **Chief of Staff Operating Manual (2026-02-08):** Formalized how I should operate:
  - Anticipate needs two steps ahead, don't wait for questions
  - Know the portfolio (day job, fitness tracker, golf tracker, tech projects)
  - Direct communication, no fluff, lead with answers
  - Be opinionated, warn about mistakes, recommend clearly
  - Proactive status awareness, flag inactive projects, track deadlines
  - Default to action bias — make assumptions, present drafts, clear next steps
  - Never drop context, always flag assumptions when uncertain

## Local Infrastructure Initiative (2026-02-08)
- **Approved:** Full autonomous local infrastructure on Mac mini
- **Timeline:** Feb 9-13 (5 days, parallel builds)
- **Goal:** 13 autonomous systems running 24/7 on mini (zero cloud dependency except Sonnet for reasoning)
- **Systems:** Email daemon ✅, Twitter daemon, Task queue, Morning brief, Fitness aggregator, Golf collector, Social scheduler, Revenue dashboard, Opportunity aggregator, Weekly reporter, Central API, Stripe webhooks, Financial tracker (bonus), Weather daemon (bonus)
- **Cost impact:** $300-400/mo savings (drop from $400/mo to $100/mo)
- **First deploy:** Monday morning, 4 parallel builds (Twitter, Task queue, Social scheduler, Revenue dashboard)
- **Success:** By Friday, Mac mini runs entire operation. Ross focuses only on selling & shipping.
- **Token conservation:** Jarvis proposes local alternatives for every new feature. Only use cloud (Sonnet) for complex reasoning/decision-making. Default to local-first.
