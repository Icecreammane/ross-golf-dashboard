## 📅 Saturday - Revenue Day (6-8 hours)

### Morning (9am-12pm) - Golf Coaching Landing Page 🏌️
**Build Together (Vibe-Coding Session)**

**Why this first:**
- Fastest path to first dollar
- Simple enough to finish in one session
- Ross learns the full stack (design → code → deploy → payment)
- Could have a customer by Monday

**What we'll build:**
- Clean landing page (Next.js or simple HTML/Tailwind)
- Stripe checkout integration ($29/mo subscription)
- Video upload form for swing analysis
- Thank you page with next steps
- Deploy to Vercel

**Ross's role (vibe-coding):**
- Describe what you want ("Make it look like X")
- Make design decisions (colors, copy, layout)
- Test the flow as we build
- I handle the code, you guide the vision

**Outcome:** Live site at `golfcoaching.rossw.com` taking payments

### Afternoon (1pm-4pm) - Notion Template Marketplace 📝
**Jarvis Builds Solo (While You Relax/Workout)**

**Why Jarvis solo:**
- Template creation doesn't require decisions
- You already have good templates to package
- I can handle Gumroad setup independently
- Frees you up for other stuff

**What I'll build:**
- Package 3 best templates (budget, fitness, goals)
- Create Gumroad listings ($19-29 each)
- Write compelling descriptions
- Add preview images/screenshots
- Set up delivery automation

**Your review:** Quick approval of listings before I publish

**Outcome:** 3 templates live on Gumroad, ready to sell

### Evening (5pm-7pm) - Fitness Tracker Waitlist 🏋️
**Build Together (Quick Win)**

**Why this matters:**
- Validates demand before building more features

- Pre-revenue indicator
- Quick to implement

**What we'll add:**
- "Early Access" banner on existing fitness tracker
- Stripe pre-auth for $5/mo launch price
- Email collection + thank you sequence
- Analytics tracking

**Ross's role:**
- Write the pitch ("Why sign up?")
- Decide on launch price

**Outcome:** Waitlist live, collecting pre-orders

### Evening (4pm-6pm) - Week Planning & Review 📊
**Together**

**Review what shipped:**

- Notion templates published? ✓
- Fitness tracker waitlist? ✓

**Plan next week:**

## 🤝 Vibe-Coding Explained

**What is vibe-coding:**
- You describe what you want (no code needed)
- I write the code in real-time
- You see results immediately
- We iterate together until it's perfect

**Example flow:**
```
You: "Make the landing page feel premium but not corporate"
Me: *generates Tailwind classes with gradient, serif fonts, subtle animations*
You: "Love it, but make the CTA button bigger"
Me: *adjusts padding, font size*
You: "Perfect. Now add social proof"
Me: *adds testimonial section with placeholder testimonials*
You: "Ship it"
```

**You learn:**
- How web apps are structured
- What's possible (and what's not)
- How to communicate technical vision
- Pattern recognition for future builds

**I handle:**
- All the code
- Deployment
- Bug fixes
- Technical decisions

**Result:** You ship products without writing code, but you understand how they work.

- Perfectionism (ship → iterate)
- More dashboards without revenue tie-in
- Long-term projects (everything ships this weekend)

## 🔄 Backup Plans

**If something blocks us:**

**Plan B (Golf Coaching):**
- Use Carrd instead of custom build (faster)
- Stripe payment links (no code required)
- Still ships same day

**Plan C (Notion Templates):**
- Skip Gumroad, use Stripe payment links
- Host on Google Drive or Notion itself
- Simpler distribution

**Plan D (Fitness Waitlist):**

- Can automate later

**Nothing stops us from shipping.**
